_the
state
of
greec
from
the
earliest
time
to
the
commenc
of
the
peloponnesian
war_

thucydid

an
athenian

wrote
the
histori
of
the
war
between
the
peloponnesian
and
the
athenian

begin
at
the
moment
that
it
broke
out

and
believ
that
it
would
be
a
great
war
and
more
worthi
of
relat
than
ani
that
had
preced
it

this
belief
was
not
without
it
ground

the
prepar
of
both
the
combat
were
in
everi
depart
in
the
last
state
of
perfect

and
he
could
see
the
rest
of
the
hellen
race
take
side
in
the
quarrel

those
who
delay
do
so
at
onc
have
it
in
contempl

indeed
this
was
the
greatest
movement
yet
known
in
histori

not
onli
of
the
hellen

but
of
a
larg
part
of
the
barbarian
world

i
had
almost
said
of
mankind

for
though
the
event
of
remot
antiqu

and
even
those
that
more
immedi
preced
the
war

could
not
from
laps
of
time
be
clear
ascertain

yet
the
evid
which
an
inquiri
carri
as
far
back
as
was
practic
lead
me
to
trust

all
point
to
the
conclus
that
there
was
noth
on
a
great
scale

either
in
war
or
in
other
matter


for
instanc

it
is
evid
that
the
countri
now
call
hella
had
in
ancient
time
no
settl
popul

on
the
contrari

migrat
were
of
frequent
occurr

the
sever
tribe
readili
abandon
their
home
under
the
pressur
of
superior
number

without
commerc

without
freedom
of
communic
either
by
land
or
sea

cultiv
no
more
of
their
territori
than
the
exig
of
life
requir

destitut
of
capit

never
plant
their
land

for
they
could
not
tell
when
an
invad
might
not
come
and
take
it
all
away

and
when
he
did
come
they
had
no
wall
to
stop
him


think
that
the
necess
of
daili
susten
could
be
suppli
at
one
place
as
well
as
anoth

they
care
littl
for
shift
their
habit

and
consequ
neither
built
larg
citi
nor
attain
to
ani
other
form
of
great

the
richest
soil
were
alway
most
subject
to
this
chang
of
master

such
as
the
district
now
call
thessali

boeotia

most
of
the
peloponnes

arcadia
except

and
the
most
fertil
part
of
the
rest
of
hella

the
good
of
the
land
favour
the
aggrandiz
of
particular
individu

and
thus
creat
faction
which
prove
a
fertil
sourc
of
ruin

it
also
invit
invas

accord
attica

from
the
poverti
of
it
soil
enjoy
from
a
veri
remot
period
freedom
from
faction

never
chang
it
inhabit

and
here
is
no
inconsider
exemplif
of
my
assert
that
the
migrat
were
the
caus
of
there
be
no
correspond
growth
in
other
part

the
most
power
victim
of
war
or
faction
from
the
rest
of
hella
took
refug
with
the
athenian
as
a
safe
retreat

and
at
an
earli
period

becom
natur

swell
the
alreadi
larg
popul
of
the
citi
to
such
a
height
that
attica
becam
at
last
too
small
to
hold
them

and
they
had
to
send
out
coloni
to
ionia


there
is
also
anoth
circumst
that
contribut
not
a
littl
to
my
convict
of
the
weak
of
ancient
time

befor
the
trojan
war
there
is
no
indic
of
ani
common
action
in
hella

nor
inde
of
the
univers
preval
of
the
name

on
the
contrari

befor
the
time
of
hellen

son
of
deucalion

no
such
appel
exist

but
the
countri
went
by
the
name
of
the
differ
tribe

in
particular
of
the
pelasgian

it
was
not
till
hellen
and
his
son
grew
strong
in
phthioti

and
were
invit
as
alli
into
the
other
citi

that
one
by
one
they
gradual
acquir
from
the
connect
the
name
of
hellen

though
a
long
time
elaps
befor
that
name
could
fasten
itself
upon
all

the
best
proof
of
this
is
furnish
by
homer

born
long
after
the
trojan
war

he
nowher
call
all
of
them
by
that
name

nor
inde
ani
of
them
except
the
follow
of
achill
from
phthioti

who
were
the
origin
hellen

in
his
poem
they
are
call
danaan

argive

and
achaean

he
doe
not
even
use
the
term
barbarian

probabl
becaus
the
hellen
had
not
yet
been
mark
off
from
the
rest
of
the
world
by
one
distinct
appel

it
appear
therefor
that
the
sever
hellen
communiti

compris
not
onli
those
who
first
acquir
the
name

citi
by
citi

as
they
came
to
understand
each
other

but
also
those
who
assum
it
afterward
as
the
name
of
the
whole
peopl

were
befor
the
trojan
war
prevent
by
their
want
of
strength
and
the
absenc
of
mutual
intercours
from
display
ani
collect
action


indeed

they
could
not
unit
for
this
expedit
till
they
had
gain
increas
familiar
with
the
sea

and
the
first
person
known
to
us
by
tradit
as
have
establish
a
navi
is
mino

he
made
himself
master
of
what
is
now
call
the
hellen
sea

and
rule
over
the
cyclad

into
most
of
which
he
sent
the
first
coloni

expel
the
carian
and
appoint
his
own
son
governor

and
thus
did
his
best
to
put
down
piraci
in
those
water

a
necessari
step
to
secur
the
revenu
for
his
own
use


for
in
earli
time
the
hellen
and
the
barbarian
of
the
coast
and
island

as
communic
by
sea
becam
more
common

were
tempt
to
turn
pirat

under
the
conduct
of
their
most
power
men

the
motiv
be
to
serv
their
own
cupid
and
to
support
the
needi

they
would
fall
upon
a
town
unprotect
by
wall

and
consist
of
a
mere
collect
of
villag

and
would
plunder
it

inde

this
came
to
be
the
main
sourc
of
their
livelihood

no
disgrac
be
yet
attach
to
such
an
achiev

but
even
some
glori

an
illustr
of
this
is
furnish
by
the
honour
with
which
some
of
the
inhabit
of
the
contin
still
regard
a
success
maraud

and
by
the
question
we
find
the
old
poet
everywher
repres
the
peopl
as
ask
of
voyag


are
they
pirat



as
if
those
who
are
ask
the
question
would
have
no
idea
of
disclaim
the
imput

or
their
interrog
of
reproach
them
for
it

the
same
rapin
prevail
also
by
land


and
even
at
the
present
day
mani
of
hella
still
follow
the
old
fashion

the
ozolian
locrian
for
instanc

the
aetolian

the
acarnanian

and
that
region
of
the
contin

and
the
custom
of
carri
arm
is
still
kept
up
among
these
continent

from
the
old
pirat
habit

the
whole
of
hella
use
onc
to
carri
arm

their
habit
be
unprotect
and
their
communic
with
each
other
unsaf

inde

to
wear
arm
was
as
much
a
part
of
everyday
life
with
them
as
with
the
barbarian

and
the
fact
that
the
peopl
in
these
part
of
hella
are
still
live
in
the
old
way
point
to
a
time
when
the
same
mode
of
life
was
onc
equal
common
to
all

the
athenian
were
the
first
to
lay
asid
their
weapon

and
to
adopt
an
easier
and
more
luxuri
mode
of
life

inde

it
is
onli
late
that
their
rich
old
men
left
off
the
luxuri
of
wear
undergar
of
linen

and
fasten
a
knot
of
their
hair
with
a
tie
of
golden
grasshopp

a
fashion
which
spread
to
their
ionian
kindr
and
long
prevail
among
the
old
men
there

on
the
contrari

a
modest
style
of
dress

more
in
conform
with
modern
idea

was
first
adopt
by
the
lacedaemonian

the
rich
do
their
best
to
assimil
their
way
of
life
to
that
of
the
common
peopl

they
also
set
the
exampl
of
contend
nake

public
strip
and
anoint
themselv
with
oil
in
their
gymnast
exercis

former

even
in
the
olympic
contest

the
athlet
who
contend
wore
belt
across
their
middl

and
it
is
but
a
few
year
sinc
that
the
practic
ceas

to
this
day
among
some
of
the
barbarian

especi
in
asia

when
prize
for
box
and
wrestl
are
offer

belt
are
worn
by
the
combat

and
there
are
mani
other
point
in
which
a
like
might
be
shown
between
the
life
of
the
hellen
world
of
old
and
the
barbarian
of
to
day


with
respect
to
their
town

later
on

at
an
era
of
increas
facil
of
navig
and
a
greater
suppli
of
capit

we
find
the
shore
becom
the
site
of
wall
town

and
the
isthmus
be
occupi
for
the
purpos
of
commerc
and
defenc
against
a
neighbour

but
the
old
town

on
account
of
the
great
preval
of
piraci

were
built
away
from
the
sea

whether
on
the
island
or
the
contin

and
still
remain
in
their
old
site

for
the
pirat
use
to
plunder
one
anoth

and
inde
all
coast
popul

whether
seafar
or
not


the
island

too

were
great
pirat

these
island
were
carian
and
phoenician

by
whom
most
of
the
island
were
colon

as
was
prove
by
the
follow
fact

dure
the
purif
of
delo
by
athen
in
this
war
all
the
grave
in
the
island
were
taken
up

and
it
was
found
that
abov
half
their
inmat
were
carian

they
were
identifi
by
the
fashion
of
the
arm
buri
with
them

and
by
the
method
of
inter

which
was
the
same
as
the
carian
still
follow

but
as
soon
as
mino
had
form
his
navi

communic
by
sea
becam
easier

as
he
colon
most
of
the
island

and
thus
expel
the
malefactor

the
coast
popul
now
began
to
appli
themselv
more
close
to
the
acquisit
of
wealth

and
their
life
becam
more
settl

some
even
began
to
build
themselv
wall
on
the
strength
of
their
newli
acquir
rich

for
the
love
of
gain
would
reconcil
the
weaker
to
the
dominion
of
the
stronger

and
the
possess
of
capit
enabl
the
more
power
to
reduc
the
smaller
town
to
subject

and
it
was
at
a
somewhat
later
stage
of
this
develop
that
they
went
on
the
expedit
against
troy


what
enabl
agamemnon
to
rais
the
armament
was
more

in
my
opinion

his
superior
in
strength

than
the
oath
of
tyndareus

which
bound
the
suitor
to
follow
him

indeed

the
account
given
by
those
peloponnesian
who
have
been
the
recipi
of
the
most
credibl
tradit
is
this

first
of
all
pelop

arriv
among
a
needi
popul
from
asia
with
vast
wealth

acquir
such
power
that

stranger
though
he
was

the
countri
was
call
after
him

and
this
power
fortun
saw
fit
materi
to
increas
in
the
hand
of
his
descend

eurystheus
had
been
kill
in
attica
by
the
heraclid

atreus
was
his
mother
s
brother

and
to
the
hand
of
his
relat

who
had
left
his
father
on
account
of
the
death
of
chrysippus

eurystheus

when
he
set
out
on
his
expedit

had
commit
mycena
and
the
govern

as
time
went
on
and
eurystheus
did
not
return

atreus
compli
with
the
wish
of
the
mycenaean

who
were
influenc
by
fear
of
the
heraclid

besid

his
power
seem
consider

and
he
had
not
neglect
to
court
the
favour
of
the
populac

and
assum
the
sceptr
of
mycena
and
the
rest
of
the
dominion
of
eurystheus

and
so
the
power
of
the
descend
of
pelop
came
to
be
greater
than
that
of
the
descend
of
perseus

to
all
this
agamemnon
succeed

he
had
also
a
navi
far
stronger
than
his
contemporari

so
that

in
my
opinion

fear
was
quit
as
strong
an
element
as
love
in
the
format
of
the
confeder
expedit

the
strength
of
his
navi
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
his
own
was
the
largest
conting

and
that
of
the
arcadian
was
furnish
by
him

this
at
least
is
what
homer
say

if
his
testimoni
is
deem
suffici

besid

in
his
account
of
the
transmiss
of
the
sceptr

he
call
him




of
mani
an
isl

and
of
all
argos
king


now
agamemnon
s
was
a
continent
power

and
he
could
not
have
been
master
of
ani
except
the
adjac
island

and
these
would
not
be
mani


but
through
the
possess
of
a
fleet


and
from
this
expedit
we
may
infer
the
charact
of
earlier
enterpris

now
mycena
may
have
been
a
small
place

and
mani
of
the
town
of
that
age
may
appear
compar
insignific

but
no
exact
observ
would
therefor
feel
justifi
in
reject
the
estim
given
by
the
poet
and
by
tradit
of
the
magnitud
of
the
armament

for
i
suppos
if
lacedaemon
were
to
becom
desol

and
the
templ
and
the
foundat
of
the
public
build
were
left

that
as
time
went
on
there
would
be
a
strong
disposit
with
poster
to
refus
to
accept
her
fame
as
a
true
expon
of
her
power

and
yet
they
occupi
two
fifth
of
peloponnes
and
lead
the
whole

not
to
speak
of
their
numer
alli
without

still

as
the
citi
is
neither
built
in
a
compact
form
nor
adorn
with
magnific
templ
and
public
edific

but
compos
of
villag
after
the
old
fashion
of
hella

there
would
be
an
impress
of
inadequaci

wherea

if
athen
were
to
suffer
the
same
misfortun

i
suppos
that
ani
infer
from
the
appear
present
to
the
eye
would
make
her
power
to
have
been
twice
as
great
as
it
is

we
have
therefor
no
right
to
be
sceptic

nor
to
content
ourselv
with
an
inspect
of
a
town
to
the
exclus
of
a
consider
of
it
power

but
we
may
safe
conclud
that
the
armament
in
question
surpass
all
befor
it

as
it
fell
short
of
modern
effort

if
we
can
here
also
accept
the
testimoni
of
homer
s
poem

in
which

without
allow
for
the
exagger
which
a
poet
would
feel
himself
licens
to
employ

we
can
see
that
it
was
far
from
equal
our

he
has
repres
it
as
consist
of
twelv
hundr
vessel

the
boeotian
complement
of
each
ship
be
a
hundr
and
twenti
men

that
of
the
ship
of
philoctet
fifti

by
this

i
conceiv

he
meant
to
convey
the
maximum
and
the
minimum
complement

at
ani
rate

he
doe
not
specifi
the
amount
of
ani
other
in
his
catalogu
of
the
ship

that
they
were
all
rower
as
well
as
warrior
we
see
from
his
account
of
the
ship
of
philoctet

in
which
all
the
men
at
the
oar
are
bowmen

now
it
is
improb
that
mani
supernumerari
sail

if
we
except
the
king
and
high
offic

especi
as
they
had
to
cross
the
open
sea
with
munit
of
war

in
ship

moreov

that
had
no
deck

but
were
equip
in
the
old
pirat
fashion

so
that
if
we
strike
the
averag
of
the
largest
and
smallest
ship

the
number
of
those
who
sail
will
appear
inconsider

repres

as
they
did

the
whole
forc
of
hella

and
this
was
due
not
so
much
to
scarciti
of

as
of
money

difficulti
of

made
the
invad
reduc
the

the
prosecut
of

even
after
the
victori
they
obtain
on
their

and
a
victori
there
must
have
been

or
the
fortif
of
the

could
never
have

there
is
no

on
the
contrari

they
seem
to
have
turn
to

to

from
want
of

this
was
what
realli
enabl
the
trojan
to
keep
the
field
for
ten
year
against

the
dispers
of
the

make
them
alway
a
match
for

if
they
had
brought
plenti
of

and
had
persev

without

for

and
agricultur

they
would
have

defeat

sinc
they
could

if
they
had

to

the

would
have
cost
them
less
time
and
less

but
as
want
of
money
prove
the
weak
of
earlier
expedit

so
from
the

caus
even
the
one
in

more
famous
than
it
predecessor

may
be
pronounc
on
the
evid
of
what
it
effect
to
have
been
inferior
to

and
to
the
current
opinion
about

under

tuition
of

even
after
the
trojan

hella
was
still
engag

and
thus
could
not
attain
to
the

must
preced

the
late
return
of

hellen
from

mani
revolut

and

ensu

and
it
was
the

thus
driven
into

who
found

sixti

after

though
there

join
the

twenti
year
later

the
dorian

the

becam
master
of

so
that
much
had
to
be
done
and
mani

had
to
elaps
befor
hella
could
attain
to
a
durabl
tranquil

could

the
peloponnesian
to

sicili
and
some
place
in
the
rest
of

all
these

were
found
subsequ

hella
began
to
fit

more
close

it
is
said
that
the
corinthian
were
the
first

approach
the
modern

of

and
that
corinth
was

the

is
shown
by

enabl

we

there

no

what

between

the
nearest
approach
to
a
coalit
took
place
in
the
old
war
between
chalci
and
eretria

this
was
a
quarrel
in
which
the
rest
of
the
hellen
name
did
to
some
extent
take
side


various

too

were
the
obstacl
which
the
nation

encount

the
power
of

when
it
came
into

under

cyrus

who

after

dethron

all
this
is
onli
true
of

for

thus
for

but
at

a

came
when

four
hundr

reckon
to

and
has
thus
been
in

of

after

great

the

of

was
assum
by
the
lacedaemonian
in

of
their

and
the
athenian

have
made
up

broke
up

and
becam

this

the

soon
afterward
split

which
includ
the

who
had

as

a
duel
into
which
all
the
hellen
sooner

later
were
drawn

though
some
might
at
first
remain
neutral

so
that
the

from

the

have

i
grant
that
there
will
be
a

in

the
way
that
most

deal
with
tradit

even
tradit
of

is
to
receiv
them
all
alik
as
they
are
deliv

without

critic
test
whatev

the
general
athenian
public
fanci
that
hipparchus
was
tyrant
when
he
fell
by
the

of
harmodius
and

not

the

that

nay
at

that

there

even
on

which
have

for

there
is
the
notion

we
can

have

despit
the

and
when
it
is
over
to
return
to

yet
an
examin

the

will
show
that
it
was
much
greater
than
the

preced

with

some

some

it
was
in

difficult
to
carri

word

so
my
habit
has
been
to
make
the

say
what
was
in

demand
of

by
the
various
occas

adher
as

so

for

they

they

that

at

safe
to

next

that

if

clear
establish

of

point

they
must
not
be
annoy
if
they
meet
with

now
the
corcyraean
believ
that
with
their
petit
for
assist
they
can
also
give
you
a
satisfactori
answer
on
these
point

and
they
have
therefor
dispatch
us
hither

it
has
so
happen
that
our
polici
as
regard
you
with
respect
to
this
request

turn
out
to
be
inconsist

and
as
regard
our
interest

to
be
at
the
present
crisi
inexpedi

we
say
inconsist

becaus
a
power
which
has
never
in
the
whole
of
her
past

been
will
to
alli
herself
with
ani
of
her

is
now
found
ask
them
to
alli
themselv
with

and
we
say
inexpedi

becaus
in
our
present
war
with
corinth
it
has
left
us
in
a
posit
of
entir
isol

and
what
onc
seem
the
wise
precaut
of
refus
to
involv
ourselv
in
allianc
with
other
power

lest
we
should
also
involv
ourselv
in
risk
of
their
choos

has
now
prove
to
be
folli
and
weak

it
is
true
that
in
the
late
naval
engag
we
drove
back
the
corinthian
from
our
shore
singl
hand

but
they
have
now
got
togeth
a
still
larger
armament
from
peloponnes
and
the
rest
of
hella

and
we

see
our
utter
inabl
to
cope
with
them
without
foreign
aid

and
the
magnitud
of
the
danger
which
subject
to
them
impli

find
it
necessari
to
ask
help
from
you
and
from
everi
other
power

and
we
hope
to
be
excus
if
we
forswear
our
old
principl
of
complet
polit
isol

a
principl
which
was
not
adopt
with
ani
sinist
intent

but
was
rather
the
consequ
of
an
error
in
judgment



now
there
are
mani
reason

yourselv

moreov

can
you
conceiv
a
stroke
of
good
fortun
more
rare
in
itself

or
more
dishearten
to

than
that
the

to
give
to
the
peopl
whose
allianc
she
solicit
as
much
safeti
and
honour
as
she
will
receiv

but
it
will
be
urg
that
it
is
onli
in
the
case
of
a
war
that
we
shall
be
found
use

to
this
we
answer
that
if
ani
of
you
imagin
that
that
war
is
far
off

he
is
grievous
mistaken

and
is
blind
to
the
fact
that
lacedaemon
regard
you
with
jealousi
and
desir
war

and
that
corinth
is
power
there

the
same

rememb

that
is
your
enemi

and
is
even
now
tri
to
subdu
us
as
a
preliminari
to
attack
you

and
this
she
doe
to
prevent
our
becom
unit
by
a
common
enmiti

and
her
have
us
both
on
her
hand

and
also
to
ensur
get
the
start
of
you
in
one
of
two
way

either
by
crippl
our
power
or
by
make
it
strength
her
own

now
it
is
our
polici
to
be
beforehand
with
her

that
is

for
corcyra
to
make
an
offer
of
allianc
and
for
you
to
accept
it

in
fact

we
ought
to
form
plan
against
her
instead
of
wait
to
defeat
the
plan
she
form
against
us



if
she
assert
that
for
you
to
receiv
a
coloni
of
her
into
allianc
is
not
right

let
her
know
that
everi
coloni
that
is
well
treat
honour
it
parent
state

but
becom
estrang
from
it
by
injustic

for
colonist
are
not
sent
forth
on
the
understand
that
they
are
to
be
the
slave
of
those
that
remain
behind

but
that
they
are
to
be
their
equal

and
that
corinth
was
injur
us
is
clear

invite
to
refer
the
disput
about
epidamnus
to
arbitr

they
chose
to
prosecut
their
complaint
war
rather
than
by
a
fair
trial

and
let
their
conduct
toward
us
who
are
their
kindr
be
a
warn
to
you
not
to
be
misl
by
their
deceit

nor
to
yield
to
their
direct
request

concess
to
adversari
onli
end
in
self
reproach

and
the
more
strict
they
are
avoid
the
greater
will
be
the
chanc
of
secur



if
it
be
urg
that
your
recept
of
us
will
be
a
breach
of
the
treati
exist
between
you
and
lacedaemon

the
answer
is
that
we
are
a
neutral
state

and
that
one
of
the
express
provis
of
that
treati
is
that
it
shall
be
compet
for
ani
hellen
state
that
is
neutral
to
join
whichev
side
it
pleas

and
it
is
intoler
for
corinth
to
be
allow
to
obtain
men
for
her
navi
not
onli
from
her
alli

but
also
from
the
rest
of
hella

no
small
number
be
furnish
by
your
own
subject

while
we
are
to
be
exclud
both
from
the
allianc
left
open
to
us
by
treati

and
from
ani
assist
that
we
might
get
from
other
quarter

and
you
are
to
be
accus
of
polit
immor
if
you
compli
with
our
request

on
the
other
hand

we
shall
have
much
greater
caus
to
complain
of
you

if
you
do
not
compli
with
it

if
we

who
are
in
peril
and
are
no
enemi
of
your

meet
with
a
repuls
at
your
hand

while
corinth

who
is
the
aggressor
and
your
enemi

not
onli
meet
with
no
hindranc
from
you

but
is
even
allow
to
draw
materi
for
war
from
your
depend

this
ought
not
to
be

but
you
should
either
forbid
her
enlist
men
in
your
dominion

or
you
should
lend
us
too
what
help
you
may
think
advis



but
your
real
polici
is
to
afford
us
avow
counten
and
support

the
advantag
of
this
cours

as
we
premis
in
the
begin
of
our
speech

are
mani

we
mention
one
that
is
perhap
the
chief

could
there
be
a
clearer
guarante
of
our
good
faith
than
is
offer
by
the
fact
that
the
power
which
is
at
enmiti
with
you
is
also
at
enmiti
with
us

and
that
that
power
is
fulli
abl
to
punish
defect

and
there
is
a
wide
differ
between
declin
the
allianc
of
an
inland
and
of
a
maritim
power

for
your
first
endeavour
should
be
to
prevent

if
possibl

the
exist
of
ani
naval
power
except
your
own

fail
this

to
secur
the
friendship
of
the
strongest
that
doe
exist

and
if
ani
of
you
believ
that
what
we
urg
is
expedi

but
fear
to
act
upon
this
belief

lest
it
should
lead
to
a
breach
of
the
treati

you
must
rememb
that
on
the
one
hand

whatev
your
fear

your
strength
will
be
formid
to
your
antagonist

on
the
other

whatev
the
confid
you
deriv
from
refus
to
receiv
us

your
weak
will
have
no
terror
for
a
strong
enemi

you
must
also
rememb
that
your
decis
is
for
athen
no
less
than
corcyra

and
that
you
are
not
make
the
best
provis
for
her
interest

if
at
a
time
when
you
are
anxious
scan
the
horizon
that
you
may
be
in
readi
for
the
break
out
of
the
war
which
is
all
but
upon
you

you
hesit
to
attach
to
your
side
a
place
whose
adhes
or
estrang
is
alik
pregnant
with
the
most
vital
consequ

for
it
lie
conveni
for
the
coast
navig
in
the
direct
of
itali
and
sicili

be
abl
to
bar
the
passag
of
naval
reinforc
from
thenc
to
peloponnes

and
from
peloponnes
thither

and
it
is
in
other
respect
a
most
desir
station

to
sum
up
as
short
as
possibl

embrac
both
general
and
particular
consider

let
this
show
you
the
folli
of
sacrif
us

rememb
that
there
are
but
three
consider
naval
power
in
hella

athen

corcyra

and
corinth

and
that
if
you
allow
two
of
these
three
to
becom
one

and
corinth
to
secur
us
for
herself

you
will
have
to
hold
the
sea
against
the
unit
fleet
of
corcyra
and
peloponnes

but
if
you
receiv
us

you
will
have
our
ship
to
reinforc
you
in
the
struggl



such
were
the
word
of
the
corcyraean

after
they
had
finish

the
corinthian
spoke
as
follow



these
corcyraean
in
the
speech
we
have
just
heard
do
not
confin
themselv
to
the
question
of
their
recept
into
your
allianc

they
also
talk
of
our
be
guilti
of
injustic

and
their
be
the
victim
of
an
unjustifi
war

it
becom
necessari
for
us
to
touch
upon
both
these
point
befor
we
proceed
to
the
rest
of
what
we
have
to
say

that
you
may
have
a
more
correct
idea
of
the
ground
of
our
claim

and
have
good
caus
to
reject
their
petit

accord
to
them

their
old
polici
of
refus
all
offer
of
allianc
was
a
polici
of
moder

it
was
in
fact
adopt
for
bad
end

not
for
good

inde
their
conduct
is
such
as
to
make
them
by
no
mean
desir
of
have
alli
present
to
wit
it

or
of
have
the
shame
of
ask
their
concurr

besid

their
geograph
situat
make
them
independ
of
other

and
consequ
the
decis
in
case
where
they
injur
ani
lie
not
with
judg
appoint
by
mutual
agreement

but
with
themselv

becaus

while
they
seldom
make
voyag
to
their
neighbour

they
are
constant
be
visit
by
foreign
vessel
which
are
compel
to
put
in
to
corcyra

in
short

the
object
that
they
propos
to
themselv

in
their
specious
polici
of
complet
isol

is
not
to
avoid
share
in
the
crime
of
other

but
to
secur
monopoli
of
crime
to
themselv

the
licenc
of
outrag
wherev
they
can
compel

of
fraud
wherev
they
can
elud

and
the
enjoy
of
their
gain
without
shame

and
yet
if
they
were
the
honest
men
they
pretend
to
be

the
less
hold
that
other
had
upon
them

the
stronger
would
be
the
light
in
which
they
might
have
put
their
honesti
by
give
and
take
what
was
just



but
such
has
not
been
their
conduct
either
toward
other
or
toward
us

the
attitud
of
our
coloni
toward
us
has
alway
been
one
of
estrang
and
is
now
one
of
hostil

for

say
they


we
were
not
sent
out
to
be
ill
treat


we
rejoin
that
we
did
not
found
the
coloni
to
be
insult
by
them

but
to
be
their
head
and
to
be
regard
with
a
proper
respect

at
ani
rate
our
other
coloni
honour
us

and
we
are
much
belov
by
our
colonist

and
clear

if
the
major
are
satisfi
with
us

these
can
have
no
good
reason
for
a
dissatisfact
in
which
they
stand
alon

and
we
are
not
act
improp
in
make
war
against
them

nor
are
we
make
war
against
them
without
have
receiv
signal
provoc

besid

if
we
were
in
the
wrong

it
would
be
honour
in
them
to
give
way
to
our
wish

and
disgrac
for
us
to
trampl
on
their
moder

but
in
the
pride
and
licenc
of
wealth
they
have
sin
again
and
again
against
us

and
never
more
deepli
than
when
epidamnus

our
depend

which
they
took
no
step
to
claim
in
it
distress
upon
our
come
to
reliev
it

was
by
them
seiz

and
is
now
held
by
forc
of
arm



as
to
their
alleg
that
they
wish
the
question
to
be
first
submit
to
arbitr

it
is
obvious
that
a
challeng
come
from
the
parti
who
is
safe
in
a
command
posit
cannot
gain
the
credit
due
onli
to
him
who

befor
appeal
to
arm

in
deed
as
well
as
word

place
himself
on
a
level
with
his
adversari

in
their
case

it
was
not
befor
they
laid
sieg
to
the
place

but
after
they
at
length
understood
that
we
should
not
tame
suffer
it

that
they
thought
of
the
specious
word
arbitr

and
not
satisfi
with
their
own
misconduct
there

they
appear
here
now
requir
you
to
join
with
them
not
in
allianc
but
in
crime

and
to
receiv
them
in
spite
of
their
be
at
enmiti
with
us

but
it
was
when
they
stood
firmest
that
they
should
have
made
overtur
to
you

and
not
at
a
time
when
we
have
been
wrong
and
they
are
in
peril

nor
yet
at
a
time
when
you
will
be
admit
to
a
share
in
your
protect
those
who
never
admit
you
to
a
share
in
their
power

and
will
be
incur
an
equal
amount
of
blame
from
us
with
those
in
whose
offenc
you
had
no
hand

no

they
should
have
share
their
power
with
you
befor
they
ask
you
to
share
your
fortun
with
them



so
then
the
realiti
of
the
grievanc
we
come
to
complain
of

and
the
violenc
and
rapac
of
our
oppon

have
both
been
prove

but
that
you
cannot
equit
receiv
them

this
you
have
still
to
learn

it
may
be
true
that
one
of
the
provis
of
the
treati
is
that
it
shall
be
compet
for
ani
state

whose
name
was
not
down
on
the
list

to
join
whichev
side
it
pleas

but
this
agreement
is
not
meant
for
those
whose
object
in
join
is
the
injuri
of
other
power

but
for
those
whose
need
of
support
doe
not
aris
from
the
fact
of
defect

and
whose
adhes
will
not
bring
to
the
power
that
is
mad
enough
to
receiv
them
war
instead
of
peac

which
will
be
the
case
with
you

if
you
refus
to
listen
to
us

for
you
cannot
becom
their
auxiliari
and
remain
our
friend

if
you
join
in
their
attack

you
must
share
the
punish
which
the
defend
inflict
on
them

and
yet
you
have
the
best
possibl
right
to
be
neutral

or

fail
this

you
should
on
the
contrari
join
us
against
them

corinth
is
at
least
in
treati
with
you

with
corcyra
you
were
never
even
in
truce

but
do
not
lay
down
the
principl
that
defect
is
to
be
patron

did
we
on
the
defect
of
the
samian
record
our
vote
against
you

when
the
rest
of
the
peloponnesian
power
were
equal
divid
on
the
question
whether
they
should
assist
them

no

we
told
them
to
their
face
that
everi
power
has
a
right
to
punish
it
own
alli

whi

if
you
make
it
your
polici
to
receiv
and
assist
all
offend

you
will
find
that
just
as
mani
of
your
depend
will
come
over
to
us

and
the
principl
that
you
establish
will
press
less
heavili
on
us
than
on
yourselv



this
then
is
what
hellen
law
entitl
us
to
demand
as
a
right

but
we
have
also
advic
to
offer
and
claim
on
your
gratitud

which

sinc
there
is
no
danger
of
our
injur
you

as
we
are
not
enemi

and
sinc
our
friendship
doe
not
amount
to
veri
frequent
intercours

we
say
ought
to
be
liquid
at
the
present
junctur

when
you
were
in
want
of
ship
of
war
for
the
war
against
the
aeginetan

befor
the
persian
invas

corinth
suppli
you
with
twenti
vessel

that
good
turn

and
the
line
we
took
on
the
samian
question

when
we
were
the
caus
of
the
peloponnesian
refus
to
assist
them

enabl
you
to
conquer
aegina
and
to
punish
samo

and
we
act
thus
at
crise
when

if
ever

men
are
wont
in
their
effort
against
their
enemi
to
forget
everyth
for
the
sake
of
victori

regard
him
who
assist
them
then
as
a
friend

even
if
thus
far
he
has
been
a
foe

and
him
who
oppos
them
then
as
a
foe

even
if
he
has
thus
far
been
a
friend

inde
they
allow
their
real

to
suffer
from
their
absorb
preoccup

the
struggl



weigh
well
these
consider

and
let
your
youth
learn
what
they
are
from
their
elder

and
let
them
determin
to
do
unto
us
as
we
have
done
unto
you

and
let
them
not
acknowledg
the
justic
of
what
we
say

but
disput
it
wisdom
in
the
conting
of
war

not
onli
is
the
straightest
path
general
speak
the
wisest

but
the
come
of
the
war

which
the
corcyraean
have
use
as
a
bugbear
to
persuad
you
to
do
wrong

is
still
uncertain

and
it
is
not
worth
while
to
be
carri
away
by
it
into

it

such
were
the
word
of
the
corinthian


when
the
athenian
had
heard
both

two

held

in

first
there
was
a

for

to
be
felt
that
the
come

of

and
no

was
will
to
see
a

corcyra
sacrif
to
corinth

though
if

it
would

no

so
in

quarter
the

and
the

where

themselv
were

on

they
gain
a

success

the

forc
of

be
further
weaken
by
the
want

absent
on

see
the
corcyraean
hard
press

the
athenian
began
at

to

more
unequivoc

at

it
is
true

they
refrain
from
charg
ani

but
when
the

patent

and
the
corinthian
were
press
on

the
time
at

came
when
everi

all

and
it
came
to
this

that
the

rais
their

after

the

some

for
the
number
of
the

on

and
the
distanc

they
cover

made
it
difficult

after

had

to

this
battl
prove
far
greater
than

befor

at

between

for

after

this
task
over

they
muster
anew

and
sail

corcyraean

who
on

meet
them
with
all
their

that
were
fit

and
remain
to
them

accompani
by
the
athenian
vessel

fear
that
they
might
attempt
a
land
in
their
territori

it
was
by
this
time
get
late

and
the
paean
had
been
sung
for
the
attack

when
the
corinthian
sudden
began
to
back
water

they
had
observ
twenti
athenian
ship
sail
up

which
had
been
sent
out
afterward
to
reinforc
the
ten
vessel
by
the
athenian

who
fear

as
it
turn
out
just

the
defeat
of
the
corcyraean
and
the
inabl
of
their
hand
of
ship
to
protect
them

these
ship
were
thus
seen
by
the
corinthian
first

they
suspect
that
they
were
from
athen

and
that
those
which
they
saw
were
not
all

but
that
there
were
more
behind

they
accord
began
to
retir

the
corcyraean
meanwhil
had
not
sight
them

as
they
were
advanc
from
a
point
which
they
could
not
so
well
see

and
were
wonder
whi
the
corinthian
were
back
water

when
some
caught
sight
of
them

and
cri
out
that
there
were
ship
in
sight
ahead

upon
this
they
also
retir

for
it
was
now
get
dark

and
the
retreat
of
the
corinthian
had
suspend
hostil

thus
they
part
from
each
other

and
the
battl
ceas
with
night

the
corcyraean
were
in
their
camp
at
leukimm

when
these
twenti
ship
from
athen

under
the
command
of
glaucon

the
son
of
leagrus

and
andocid

son
of
leogora

bore
on
through
the
corps
and
the
wreck

and
sail
up
to
the
camp

not
long
after
they
were
sight

it
was
now
night

and
the
corcyraean
fear
that
they
might
be
hostil
vessel

but
they
soon
knew
them

and
the
ship
came
to
anchor


the
next
day
the
thirti
athenian
vessel
put
out
to
sea

accompani
by
all
the
corcyraean
ship
that
were
seaworthi

and
sail
to
the
harbour
at
sybota

where
the
corinthian
lay

to
see
if
they
would
engag

the
corinthian
put
out
from
the
land
and
form
a
line
in
the
open
sea

but
beyond
this
made
no
further
movement

have
no
intent
of
assum
the
offens

for
they
saw
reinforc
arriv
fresh
from
athen

and
themselv
confront
by
numer
difficulti

such
as
the
necess
of
guard
the
prison
whom
they
had
on
board
and
the
want
of
all
mean
of
refit
their
ship
in
a
desert
place

what
they
were
think
more
about
was
how
their
voyag
home
was
to
be
effect

they
fear
that
the
athenian
might
consid
that
the
treati
was
dissolv
by
the
collis
which
had
occur

and
forbid
their
departur


accord
they
resolv
to
put
some
men
on
board
a
boat

and
send
them
without
a
herald
s
wand
to
the
athenian

as
an
experi

have
done
so

they
spoke
as
follow


you
do
wrong

athenian

to
begin
war
and
break
the
treati

engage
in
chastis
our
enemi

we
find
you
place
yourselv
in
our
path
in
arm
against
us

now
if
your
intent
are
to
prevent
us
sail
to
corcyra

or
anywher
els
that
we
may
wish

and
if
you
are
for
break
the
treati

first
take
us
that
are
here
and
treat
us
as
enemi


such
was
what
they
said

and
all
the
corcyraean
armament
that
were
within
hear
immedi
call
out
to
take
them
and
kill
them

but
the
athenian
answer
as
follow


neither
are
we
begin
war

peloponnesian

nor
are
we
break
the
treati

but
these
corcyraean
are
our
alli

and
we
are
come
to
help
them

so
if
you
want
to
sail
anywher
els

we
place
no
obstacl
in
your
way

but
if
you
are
go
to
sail
against
corcyra

or
ani
of
her
possess

we
shall
do
our
best
to
stop
you



receiv
this
answer
from
the
athenian

the
corinthian
commenc
prepar
for
their
voyag
home

and
set
up
a
trophi
in
sybota

on
the
contin

while
the
corcyraean
took
up
the
wreck
and
dead
that
had
been
carri
out
to
them
by
the
current

and
by
a
wind
which
rose
in
the
night
and
scatter
them
in
all
direct

and
set
up
their
trophi
in
sybota

on
the
island

as
victor

the
reason
each
side
had
for
claim
the
victori
were
these

the
corinthian
had
been
victori
in
the
sea
fight
until
night

and
have
thus
been
enabl
to
carri
off
most
wreck
and
dead

they
were
in
possess
of
no
fewer
than
a
thousand
prison
of
war

and
had
sunk
close
upon
seventi
vessel

the
corcyraean
had
destroy
about
thirti
ship

and
after
the
arriv
of
the
athenian
had
taken
up
the
wreck
and
dead
on
their
side

they
had
besid
seen
the
corinthian
retir
befor
them

back
water
on
sight
of
the
athenian
vessel

and
upon
the
arriv
of
the
athenian
refus
to
sail
out
against
them
from
sybota

thus
both
side
claim
the
victori


the
corinthian
on
the
voyag
home
took
anactorium

which
stand
at
the
mouth
of
the
ambracian
gulf

the
place
was
taken
by
treacheri

be
common
ground
to
the
corcyraean
and
corinthian

after
establish
corinthian
settler
there

they
retir
home

eight
hundr
of
the
corcyraean
were
slave

these
they
sold

two
hundr
and
fifti
they
retain
in
captiv

and
treat
with
great
attent

in
the
hope
that
they
might
bring
over
their
countri
to
corinth
on
their
return

most
of
them
be

as
it
happen

men
of
veri
high
posit
in
corcyra

in
this
way
corcyra
maintain
her
polit
exist
in
the
war
with
corinth

and
the
athenian
vessel
left
the
island

this
was
the
first
caus
of
the
war
that
corinth
had
against
the
athenian

viz


that
they
had
fought
against
them
with
the
corcyraean
in
time
of
treati


almost
immedi
after
this

fresh
differ
aros
between
the
athenian
and
peloponnesian

and
contribut
their
share
to
the
war

corinth
was
form
scheme
for
retali

and
athen
suspect
her
hostil

the
potidaean

who
inhabit
the
isthmus
of
pallen

be
a
corinthian
coloni

but
tributari
alli
of
athen

were
order
to
raze
the
wall
look
toward
pallen

to
give
hostag

to
dismiss
the
corinthian
magistr

and
in
futur
not
to
receiv
the
person
sent
from
corinth
annual
to
succeed
them

it
was
fear
that
they
might
be
persuad
by
perdicca
and
the
corinthian
to
revolt

and
might
draw
the
rest
of
the
alli
in
the
direct
of
thrace
to
revolt
with
them

these
precaut
against
the
potidaean
were
taken
by
the
athenian
immedi
after
the
battl
at
corcyra

not
onli
was
corinth
at
length
open
hostil

but
perdicca

son
of
alexand

king
of
the
macedonian

had
from
an
old
friend
and
alli
been
made
an

he
had
been
made
an
enemi
by
the
athenian
enter
into
allianc
with
his
brother
philip
and
derda

who
were
in
leagu
against
him

in
his
alarm
he
had
sent
to
lacedaemon
to
tri
and
involv
the
athenian
in
a
war
with
the
peloponnesian

and
was
endeavour
to
win
over
corinth
in
order
to
bring
about
the
revolt
of
potidaea

he
also
made
overtur
to
the
chalcidian
in
the
direct
of
thrace

and
to
the
bottiaean

to
persuad
them
to
join
in

for
he
thought
that

you

complaint

neglect

now
if
these
assault

had
been
made
in

you

it

in

we
fear

it
said
more

the

and
that
if

we

such

with

your

if

you

now
you

in

your

thus
it

here

at

let

for

assist

as
you

and
drive
the

to

such
a

would
not
be
condemn
either
by

the

it

for

reason
choos
the

and
endeavour
not

degener

such
were
the
word
of
the
corinthian

there
happen
to
be
athenian
envoy
present
at
lacedaemon
on
other
busi

on
hear
the
speech
they
thought
themselv
call
upon
to
come
befor
the
lacedaemonian

their
intent
was
not
to
offer
a
defenc
on
ani
of
the
charg
which
the
citi
brought
against
them

but
to
show
on
a
comprehens
view
that
it
was
not
a
matter
to
be
hastili
decid
on

but
one
that
demand
further
consider

there
was
also
a
wish
to
call
attent
to
the
great
power
of
athen

and
to
refresh
the
memori
of
the
old
and
enlighten
the
ignor
of
the
young

from
a
notion
that
their
word
might
have
the
effect
of
induc
them
to
prefer
tranquil
to
war

so
they
came
to
the
lacedaemonian
and
said
that
they
too

if
there
was
no
object

wish
to
speak
to
their
assembl

they
repli
by
invit
them
to
come
forward

the
athenian
advanc

and
spoke
as
follow



the
object
of
our
mission
here
was
not
to
argu
with
your
alli

but
to
attend
to
the
matter
on
which
our
state
dispatch
us

howev

the
vehem
of
the
outcri
that
we
hear
against
us
has
prevail
on
us
to
come
forward

it
is
not
to
combat
the
accus
of
the
citi

inde
you
are
not
the
judg
befor
whom
either
we
or
they
can
plead


but
to
prevent
your
take
the
wrong
cours
on
matter
of
great
import
by
yield
too
readili
to
the
persuas
of
your
alli

we
also
wish
to
show
on
a
review
of
the
whole
indict
that
we
have
a
fair
titl
to
our
possess

and
that
our
countri
has
claim
to
consider

we
need
not
refer
to
remot
antiqu

there
we
could
appeal
to
the
voic
of
tradit

but
not
to
the
experi
of
our
audienc

but
to
the
median
war
and
contemporari
histori
we
must
refer

although
we
are
rather
tire
of
continu
bring
this
subject
forward

in
our
action
dure
that
war
we
ran
great
risk
to
obtain
certain
advantag

you
had
your
share
in
the
solid
result

do
not
tri
to
rob
us
of
all
share
in
the
good
that
the
glori
may
do
us

howev

the
stori
shall
be
told
not
so
much
to
deprec
hostil
as
to
testifi
against
it

and
to
show

if
you
are
so
ill
advis
as
to
enter
into
a
struggl
with
athen

what
sort
of
an
antagonist
she
is
like
to
prove

we
assert
that
at
marathon
we
were
at
the
front

and
face
the
barbarian
singl
hand

that
when
he
came
the
second
time

unabl
to
cope
with
him
by
land
we
went
on
board
our
ship
with
all
our
peopl

and
join
in
the
action
at
salami

this
prevent
his
take
the
peloponnesian
state
in
detail

and
ravag
them
with
his
fleet

when
the
multitud
of
his
vessel
would
have
made
ani
combin
for
self
defenc
imposs

the
best
proof
of
this
was
furnish
by
the
invad
himself

defeat
at
sea

he
consid
his
power
to
be
no
longer
what
it
had
been

and
retir
as
speedili
as
possibl
with
the
greater
part
of
his

such

then

was
the
result
of
the
matter

and
it
was
clear
prove
that
it
was
on
the
fleet
of

that

to
this
result
we
contribut

the

the

the

our

to
throw

without
a

of

your

we
assert

therefor

that
we

if

sure

lacedaemonian

neither
by

that

by

do

merit
our

not
at

unpopular
for

that
empir
we
acquir
by

but
becaus
you
were
unwil
to
prosecut
to

the

against

and
becaus
the

attach
themselv

when

when
you
had

that
you
onc

it
appear
no

safe
to
give
up
our

as
all
who
left

would
fall

and
no

can
quarrel
with

you

at

lacedaemonian

have
use
your

settl

as
is
agreeabl
to

and
if
at

of
which
we
were

you
had
persev
to
the
end
of
the
matter

and
had
incur
hatr
in

we
are
sure
that
you
would
have
made
yourselv
just
as
gall
to
the
alli

and
would
have
been
forc
to
choos
between
a

to

it
follow
that
it
was
not
a

wonder
action

or
contrari
to
the
common
practic
of

if
we
did
accept
an

and
refus
to
give

up
under
the
pressur
of
three
of
the
strongest

fear

honour

and

and
it
was
not
we
who
set
the
exampl

for
it
has
alway
been
law
that
the
weaker
should
be
subject
to
the

besid

we
believ
ourselv
to
be
worthi
of

and
so
you
thought
us
till
now

when
calcul
of
interest
have
made
you
take
up
the
cri
of
justic

a
consider
which
no
one
ever
yet
brought
forward
to
hinder
his
ambit
when
he
had
a
chanc
of
gain
anyth
by
might

and
prais
is
due
to
all
who

if
not
so
superior
to
human
natur
as
to
refus
dominion

yet
respect
justic
more
than
their
posit
compel
them
to
do



we
imagin
that
our
moder
would
be
best
demonstr
by
the
conduct
of
other
who
should
be
place
in
our
posit

but
even
our
equiti
has
veri
unreason
subject
us
to
condemn
instead
of
approv

our
abat
of
our
right
in
the
contract
trial
with
our
alli

and
our
caus
them
to
be
decid
by

law
at

have
gain
us
the
charact
of

litigi

and
none
care
to
inquir
whi
this
reproach
is
not
brought
against
other
imperi
power

who
treat
their
subject
with
less
moder
than
we
do

the
secret
be
that
where
forc
can
be
use

law
is
not
need

but
our
subject
are
so
habitu
to
associ
with
us
as
equal
that
ani
defeat
whatev
that
clash
with
their
notion
of
justic

whether
it
proceed
from
a
legal
judgment
or
from
the
power
which
our
empir
give
us

make
them
forget
to
be
grate
for
be
allow
to
retain
most
of
their
possess

and
more
vex
at
a
part
be
taken

than
if
we
had
from
the
first
cast
law
asid
and
open
gratifi
our
covet

if
we
had
done
so

not
even
would
they
have
disput
that
the
weaker
must
give
way
to
the
stronger

men
s
indign

it
seem

is
more
excit
by
legal
wrong
than
by
violent
wrong

the
first
look
like
be
cheat
by
an
equal

the
second
like
be
compel
by
a
superior

at
all
event
they
contriv
to
put
up
with
much
wors
treatment
than
this
from
the
mede

yet
they
think
our
rule
sever

and
this
is
to
be
expect

for
the
present
alway
weigh
heavi
on
the
conquer

this
at
least
is
certain

if
you
were
to
succeed
in
overthrow
us
and
in
take
our
place

you
would
speedili
lose
the
popular
with
which
fear
of

has
invest
you

if
your

of

is
at
all
to

with
the

that
you
gave

the

your

act
neither

take
time
then
in

your

as
the
matter
is
of
great
import

and
do
not
be
persuad
by
the
opinion
and
complaint
of

to
bring

consid
the
vast

befor

as
it
continu

it

becom
an

chanc
from
which
neither

is
exempt

and
whose

we
must
risk
in

it
is
a
common
mistak
in
go
to
war
to
begin
at
the
wrong
end

to
act
first

and
wait
for
disast
to

but
we
are
not

nor

so

as

are

while

to

we

you
not

to

such
were
the
word
of
the
athenian

after
the
lacedaemonian
had
heard
the
complaint
of
the
alli
against
the
athenian

and
the
observ
of
the
latter

they
made
all
withdraw

and
consult
by
themselv
on
the
question
befor
them

the
opinion
of
the
major
all
led
to
the

conclus

the
athenian
were
open
aggressor

and
war
must
be
declar

archidamus

the
lacedaemonian
king

came
forward

who
had
the
reput

made

the
war
on
which
you
are
now
debat

would
be
one
of
the
greatest
magnitud

on
a
sober
consider
of
the
matter

in
a
struggl
with
peloponnesian
and
neighbour
our
strength
is
of
the
same
charact

and
it
is
possibl
to
move
swift
on
the
differ
point

but
a
struggl
with
a
peopl
who
live
in
a
distant
land

who
have
also
an
extraordinari
familiar
with
the
sea

and
who
are
in
the
highest
state
of
prepar
in
everi
other
depart

with
wealth
privat
and
public

with
ship

and
hors

and
heavi
infantri

and
a
popul
such
as
no
one
other
hellen
place
can
equal

and
last
a
number
of
tributari
alli

what
can
justifi
us
in
rash
begin
such
a
struggl

wherein
is
our
trust
that
we
should
rush
on
it
unprepar

is
it
in
our
ship

there
we
are
inferior

while
if
we
are
to
practis
and
becom
a
match
for
them

time
must
interven

is
it
in
our
money

there
we
have
a
far
greater
defici

we
neither
have
it
in
our
treasuri

nor
are
we
readi
to
contribut
it
from
our
privat
fund

confid
might
possibl
be
felt
in
our
superior
in
heavi
infantri
and
popul

which
will
enabl
us
to
invad
and
devast
their
land

but
the
athenian
have
plenti
of
other
land
in
their
empir

and
can
import
what
they
want
by
sea

again

if
we
are
to
attempt
an
insurrect
of
their
alli

these
will
have
to
be
support
with
a
fleet

most
of
them
be
island

what
then
is
to
be
our
war

for
unless
we
can
either
beat
them
at
sea

or
depriv
them
of
the
revenu
which
feed
their
navi

we
shall
meet
with
littl
but
disast

meanwhil
our
honour
will
be
pledg
to
keep
on

particular
if
it
be
the
opinion
that
we
began
the
quarrel

for
let
us
never
be
elat
by
the
fatal
hope
of
the
war
be
quick
end
by
the
devast
of
their
land

i
fear
rather
that
we
may
leav
it
as
a
legaci
to
our
children

so
improb
is
it
that
the
athenian
spirit
will
be
the
slave
of
their
land

or
athenian
experi
be
cow
by
war



not
that
i
would
bid
you
be
so
unfeel
as
to
suffer
them
to
injur
your
alli

and
to
refrain
from
unmask
their
intrigu

but
i
do
bid
you
not
to
take
up
arm
at
onc

but
to
send
and
remonstr
with
them
in
a
tone
not
too
suggest
of
war

nor
again
too
suggest
of
submiss

and
to
employ
the
interv
in
perfect
our
own
prepar

the
mean
will
be

first

the
acquisit
of
alli

hellen
or
barbarian
it
matter
not

so
long
as
they
are
an
access
to
our
strength
naval
or
pecuniari

i
say
hellen
or
barbarian

becaus
the
odium
of
such
an
access
to
all
who
like
us
are
the
object
of
the
design
of
the
athenian
is
taken
away
by
the
law
of
self
preserv

and
second
the
develop
of
our
home
resourc

if
they
listen
to
our
embassi

so
much
the
better

but
if
not

after
the
laps
of
two
or
three
year
our
posit
will
have
becom
materi
strengthen

and
we
can
then
attack
them
if
we
think
proper

perhap
by
that
time
the
sight
of
our

back
by
languag
equal
signific

will
have
dispos
them
to
submiss

while
their

is
still

and
while
their

may
be
direct
to
the
retent
of
advantag
as
yet
undestroy

for
the
onli
light
in
which
you
can
view
their

is
that
of
a

in
your

a
hostag
the
more
valuabl
the
better
it
is
cultiv

this
you
ought
to
spare

not

the

have

a

not

this
is
more
than

of

and
spoke
to
the

as
follow



the
long
speech
of
the
athenian
i
do
not
pretend
to
understand

they
said
a
good
deal
in

of
themselv

nowher
deni
that
they
are
injur

ill
toward

they
deserv

we
meanwhil
are
the

then

now

and
shall
not

if
we
are
wise

disregard
the
wrong
of
our

or
put
off
till
to

the

of
assist
those
who
must
suffer
to

other
have
much
money

but
we
have
good
alli
whom
we
must
not
give
up
to
the
athenian

nor
by
lawsuit
and
word
decid
the
matter

as
it
is
anyth
but
in
word
that
we
are
harm

but
render

power
help

and
let

the

neither

but
with

let
us
advanc

with
these
word
he

as

himself
put
the
question
to

he
said
that

their
mode
of

by

not

the

be
that
he

thus
to

fit
to
abandon
their
citi
and
to
embark
in
their
ship

they
ventur
on
that
peril
step
without
consult
them

and
that
on
the
other
hand

wherev
they
had
deliber
with
the
lacedaemonian

they
had
prove
themselv
to
be
in
judgment
second
to
none

that
they
now
thought
it
fit
that
their
citi
should
have
a
wall

and
that
this
would
be
more
for
the
advantag
of
both
the
citizen
of
athen
and
the
hellen
confederaci

for
without
equal
militari
strength
it
was
imposs
to
contribut
equal
or
fair
counsel
to
the
common
interest

it
follow

he
observ

either
that
all
the
member
of
the
confederaci
should
be
without
wall

or
that
the
present
step
should
be
consid
a
right
one


the
lacedaemonian
did
not
betray
ani
open
sign
of
anger
against
the
athenian
at
what
they
heard

the
embassi

it
seem

was
prompt
not
by
a
desir
to
obstruct

but
to
guid
the
counsel
of
their
govern

besid

spartan
feel
was
at
that
time
veri
friend
toward
athen
on
account
of
the
patriot
which
she
had
display
in
the
struggl
with
the
mede

still
the
defeat
of
their
wish
could
not
but
caus
them
secret
annoy

the
envoy
of
each
state
depart
home
without
complaint


in
this
way
the
athenian
wall
their
citi
in
a
littl
while

to
this
day
the
build
show
sign
of
the

of
it

the

laid
of

of
all

and
in
some
place
not
wrought
or
fit

but
place
just
in
the
order
in
which
they
were
brought
by
the
differ

and
mani

for

and
so
they
laid
hand
on
everyth
without

in
their
hast

themistocl
also
persuad
them
to
finish
the
wall
of
piraeus

which
had
been
begun
befor

in
his
year
of
offic
as
archon

be
influenc
alik
by
the
fine
of
a
local
that
has
three
natur
harbour

and
by
the
great
start
which
the
athenian
would
gain
in
the
acquisit
of
power
by
becom
a
naval
peopl

for
he
first
ventur
to
tell
them
to
stick
to
the
sea
and
forthwith
began
to
lay
the
foundat
of
the
empir

it
was
by
his
advic

too

that
they
built
the
wall
of
that
thick
which
can
still
be
discern
round
piraeus

the
stone
be
brought
up
by
two
wagon
meet
each
other

between
the
wall
thus
form
there
was
neither
rubbl
nor
mortar

but
great
stone
hewn
squar
and
fit
togeth

cramp
to
each
other
on
the
outsid
with
iron
and
lead

about
half
the
height
that
he
intend
was
finish

his
idea
was
by
their
size
and
thick
to
keep
off
the
attack
of
an
enemi

he
thought
that
they
might
be
adequ
defend
by
a
small
garrison
of
invalid

and
the
rest
be
freed
for
servic
in
the
fleet

for
the
fleet
claim
most
of
his
attent

he
saw

as
i
think

that
the
approach
by
sea
was
easier
for
the
king
s
armi
than
that
by
land

he
also
thought
piraeus
more
valuabl
than
the
upper
citi

inde

he
was
alway
advis
the
athenian

if
a
day
should
come
when
they
were
hard
press
by
land

to
go
down
into
piraeus

and
defi
the
world
with
their
fleet

thus

therefor

the
athenian
complet
their
wall

and
commenc
their
other
build
immedi
after
the
retreat
of
the
mede


meanwhil
pausania

son
of

was
sent
out

with

the

they
made

subdu
most
of

and
afterward
against
byzantium

which
was
in
the
hand
of
the
mede

and
compel
it
to
surrend

this
event
took
place
while
the
spartan
were
still
suprem

but
the
violenc
of
pausania
had
alreadi
begun
to
be
disagre
to
the
hellen

particular
to
the
ionian
and
the
newli

these
resort
to

request
them
as
their
kinsmen
to
becom
their
leader

and
to
stop
ani
attempt
at
violenc
on
the
part
of

the
athenian
accept

and
determin
to
put
down

and
to
settl

their

to

in

the

recal
pausania
for
an

the
report
which
had
reach
them

manifold
and
grave
accus
had
been
brought
against
him
by
hellen
arriv
in

and

to
all
appear

there
had
been
in
him
more
of
the
mimicri
of
a
despot
than
of
the
attitud
of
a

as
it
happen

his
recal
came
just
at
the
time
when
the
hatr
which
he
had
inspir
had
induc
the

to
desert

the

from

except

and
to

themselv
by
the
side
of
the
athenian

on
his
arriv
at
lacedaemon

he
was
censur
for
his
privat
act
of
oppress

but
was
acquit
on
the
heaviest
count
and
pronounc
not
guilti

it
must
be
known
that
the
charg
of
medism
form
one
of
the
princip

and
to
all
appear
one
of
the
best
found

articl
against
him

the
lacedaemonian
did
not

howev

restor
him
to
his
command

but
sent
out
dorki
and
certain
other
with
a
small
forc

who
found
the
alli
no
longer
inclin
to
conced
to
them
the
supremaci

perceiv
this
they
depart

and
the
lacedaemonian
did
not
send
out
ani
to
succeed
them

they
fear
for
those
who
went
out
a
deterior
similar
to
that
observ
in
pausania

besid

they
desir
to
be
rid
of
the
median
war

and
were
satisfi
of
the
compet
of
the
athenian
for
the
posit

and
of
their
friendship
at
the
time
toward
themselv


the
athenian

have
thus
succeed
to
the
supremaci
by
the
voluntari
act
of
the
alli
through
their
hatr
of
pausania

fix
which
citi
were

which
ship

their

be

the

against

against

which
would
come
in

on

occas

my
excus
for

and
for

on

is
that
this

of

has
been
omit
by

who
have
confin
themselv
either
to

histori
befor

or
the

itself

hellanicus

it
is
true

did
touch
on
these
event
in
his
athenian
histori

but
he
is
somewhat
concis
and
not
accur
in
his
date

besid

the
histori
of
these
event
contain
an
explan
of
the
growth
of
the
athenian
empir


first
the
athenian
besieg
and
captur
eion
on

from

and
made

next
they
enslav
scyro

the
island
in
the
aegean

contain
a
dolopian
popul

and
colon
it
themselv

this
was
follow
by
a
war
against
carystus

in
which
the
rest
of
euboea
remain
neutral

and
which
was
end
by
surrend
on
condit

after
this
naxo
left
the
confederaci

and
a

ensu

and
she
had

this
was
the
first
instanc
of
the

be
broken
by
the
subjug

a
preced
which
was
follow
by
that
of

in

order
which
circumst
prescrib

of
all
the
caus
of
defect

that
connect
with

and
with
failur
of

was
the
chief

for
the
athenian
were
veri
sever

exact

and
made
themselv
offens

appli
the
screw
of
necess

men
who
were
not
use
to

in
fact
not
dispos
for
ani
continu
labour

in
some
other
respect
the
athenian
were
not
the
old
popular
ruler
they
had
been
at
first

and
if
they
had
more
than
their
fair
share
of
servic

it
was
correspond
easi
for
them
to
reduc
ani
that
tri
to
leav
the

for
this
the
alli
had
themselv
to
blame

the
wish
to
get
off
servic
make
most
of
them
arrang
to
pay
their
share
of
the
expens
in
money
instead
of
in

and
so
to
avoid
have
to

thus
while
athen
was
increas
her
navi
with
the
fund
which
they
contribut

a
revolt
alway
found
them
without
resourc
or

next
we
come
to
the
action
by
land
and
by

at
the
river
eurymedon

between
the
athenian
with
their

and
the

when
the

the

defeat

about

without

she

but
was
prevent

most
of

that
were
enslav

and
so
all

came
to

so
the

invok
the

of
their

and
especi
of
the
athenian

who
came
in
some
forc
under
the
command
of
cimon

the
reason
for
this
press
summon
lay
in
their
reput
skill
in
sieg
oper

a
long
sieg
had
taught
the
lacedaemonian
their
own
defici
in
this
art

els
they
would
have
taken
the
place
by
assault

the
first
open
quarrel
between
the

aros
out
of
this

the
lacedaemonian

when
assault
fail
to
take

apprehens
of
the
enterpris
and
revolutionari
charact
of
the
athenian

and
further
look
upon
them
as
of
alien

began
to
fear
that

if

they

tempt
by

they
accord
dismiss

without

but
mere
say
that

no

but
the
athenian

awar
that
their

did
not
proceed
from
the
more
honour
reason
of
the
two

but
from
suspicion
which
had
been
conceiv

went
away
deepli
offend

and
conscious
of
have
done
noth
to
merit
such
treatment
from
the
lacedaemonian

and
the
instant
that
they
return

they
broke
off
the

meanwhil
the

unabl
to

further
a

the
condit
be
that

ani
one
who
might
hereaft

to

it
must
be
known
that
the

had
an
old
oracl
from
delphi

to
the
effect
that
they
should
let
go
the
suppliant

so
they
went

canvass
the

to

to

in
the

they

fellow

we

the

they
have
not

we

their

in

for
the

accord
to

by

in
other

for
ourselv

all
who
have
alreadi
had
deal
with
the
athenian
requir
no
warn
to
be
on
their
guard
against
them

the
state
more
inland
and
out
of
the
highway
of
communic
should
understand
that

if
they
omit
to
support
the
coast
power

the
result
will
be
to
injur
the
transit
of
their
produc
for
export
and
the
recept
in
exchang
of
their
import
from
the

and
they
must
not
be
careless
judg
of
what
is
now
said

as
if
it
had
noth
to
do
with
them

but
must
expect
that
the
sacrific
of
the
power
on
the
coast
will
one
day
be
follow
by
the
extens
of
the
danger
to
the
interior

and
must
recogn
that
their
own
interest
are
deepli
involv
in
this
discuss

for
these
reason
they
should
not
hesit
to
exchang
peac
for
war

if
wise
men
remain
quiet

while
they
are
not

brave
men
abandon
peac
for

when
they
are

return
to
an

on

in

they
are
neither

by
their

in

nor
dispos

take
an
injuri
for
the
sake
of
the
delight
tranquil
of
peac

indeed

to
falter
for
the
sake
of
such
delight
is

if
you
remain
inact

the
quickest
way
of
lose
the
sweet
of
repos
to
which
you
cling

while
to
conceiv
extravag
pretens
from

in

is
to
forget
how
hollow
is
the
confid
by
which
you
are

for

the

with

is

is
carri

but

when
it
come
to
action

fear
caus
failur



to
appli
these
rule
to
ourselv

if
we
are
now
kindl
war
it
is
under
the
pressur
of
injuri

with
adequ
ground
of
complaint

and
after
we
have
chastis
the
athenian
we
will
in
season
desist

we
have
mani
reason
to
expect
success

first

superior
in
number
and
in
militari
experi

and
second
our
general
and
unvari
obedi
in
the
execut
of
order

the
naval
strength
which
they
possess
shall
be
rais
by
us
from
our
respect
anteced
resourc

and
from
the
money
at
olympia
and
delphi

a
loan
from
these
enabl
us
to
seduc
their
foreign
sailor
by
the
offer
of
higher
pay

for
the
power
of
athen
is
more
mercenari
than
nation

while
our
will
not
be
expos
to
the
same
risk

as
it
strength
lie
more
in
men
than
in
money

a
singl
defeat
at
sea
is
in
all
likelihood
their
ruin

should
they
hold
out

in
that
case
there
will
be
the
more
time
for
us
to
exercis
ourselv
in
naval
matter

and
as
soon
as
we
have
arriv
at
an
equal
in
scienc

we
need
scarc
ask
whether
we
shall
be
their
superior
in
courag

for
the
advantag
that
we
have
by
natur
they
cannot
acquir
by
educ

while
their
superior
in
scienc
must
be
remov
by
our
practic

the
money
requir
for
these
object
shall
be
provid
by
our
contribut

noth
inde
could
be
more
monstrous
than
the
suggest
that

while
their
alli
never
tire
of
contribut
for
their
own
servitud

we
should
refus
to
spend
for
vengeanc
and
self
preserv
the
treasur
which
by
such
refus
we
shall
forfeit
to
athenian
rapac
and
see
employ
for
our
own
ruin



we
have
also
other
way
of
carri
on
the
war

such
as
revolt
of
their
alli

the
surest
method
of
depriv
them
of
their
revenu

which
are
the
sourc
of
their
strength

and
establish
of
fortifi
posit
in
their
countri

and
various
oper
which
cannot
be
foreseen
at
present

for
war
of
all
thing
proceed
least
upon
definit
rule

but
draw
princip
upon
itself
for
contriv
to
meet
an
emerg

and
in
such
case
the
parti
who
face
the
struggl
and
keep
his
temper
best
meet
with
most
secur

and
he
who
lose
his
temper
about
it
with
correspond
disast

let
us
also
reflect
that
if
it
was
mere
a
number
of
disput
of
territori
between
rival
neighbour

it
might
be
born

but
here
we
have
an
enemi
in
athen
that
is
a
match
for
our
whole
coalit

and
more
than
a
match
for
ani
of
it
member

so
that
unless
as
a
bodi
and
as
individu
nation
and
individu
citi
we
make
an
unanim
stand
against
her

she
will
easili
conquer
us
divid
and
in

that
conquest

terribl
as
it
may
sound

would

it
must
be
known

have
no
other
end
than
slaveri
pure
and
simpl

a
word
which
peloponnes
cannot
even
hear
whisper
without
disgrac

or
without

see
so
mani
state
abus
by
one

meanwhil
the
opinion
would
be
either
that
we
were
just
so
use

or
that
we
put
up
with
it
from
cowardic

and
were
prove
degener
son
in
not
even
secur
for
ourselv
the
freedom
which
our
father
gave
to
hella

and
in
allow
the
establish
in
hella
of
a
tyrant
state

though
in
individu
state
we
think
it
our
duti
to
put
down
sole
ruler

and
we
do
not
know
how
this
conduct
can
be
held
free
from
three
of
the
gravest
fail

want
of
sens

of
courag

or
of
vigil

for
we
do
not
suppos
that
you
have
taken
refug
in
that
contempt
of
an
enemi
which
has
prove
so
fatal
in
so
mani
instanc

a
feel
which
from
the
number
that
it
has
ruin
has
come
to
be

contempt



there
is

howev

no
advantag
in

on
the

further
than
may
be
of

to

for
the

we

provid

present
give

and
redoubl
our
effort

it
is
hereditari
to
us
to
win

and
you
must
not
chang
the
habit

even
though
you
should
have
a

in

and

for
it
is
not

that

we

the

such
were
the

the

this
decid

it
was
still
imposs
for

to
commenc

from
their
want
of

but
it
was
resolv
that
the
mean
requisit
were
to
be
procur

and
that
there
was
to
be
no

in

occupi

arrang

less
than
a

elaps
befor
attica
was
invad

and

open
begun


this

was
spent
in
send
embassi
to

charg
with

in

to
obtain
as
good
a
pretext
for

as
possibl

in
the
event
of

pay
no
attent
to
them

the
first
lacedaemonian
embassi
was
to
order
the
athenian
to
drive
out
the
curs
of
the
goddess

the
histori
of
which
is
as
follow

in
former
generat
there
was
an
athenian
of
the
name
of
cylon

a
victor
at
the
olympic

of
good
birth
and
power
posit

who
had
marri
a

of

a
megarian

at

tyrant
of

now
this
cylon
was
inquir
at

when

was
told
by
the
god
to
seiz
the
acropoli
of
athen
on
the
grand
festiv
of

accord

procur
a
forc
from
theagen
and
persuad
his
friend
to
join
him

when
the
olympic
festiv
in
peloponnes
came

he
seiz
the
acropoli

with
the
intent
of
make
himself
tyrant

think
that
this
was
the
grand
festiv
of
zeus

and
also
an
occas
appropri
for
a
victor
at
the
olympic
game

whether
the
grand
festiv
that
was
meant
was
in
attica
or
elsewher
was
a
question
which
he
never
thought
of

and
which
the
oracl
did
not
offer
to

for
the
athenian
also
have
a

howev

fanci
he
had
chosen
the
right

he
made
the
attempt

as
soon
as
the
athenian
perceiv
it

they
flock
in

one
and
all

from
the
countri

and
sat
down

and
laid
sieg
to
the

but
as

went

most

left
to
the

with

it
must
be

were

some

from

the

these

were
driven

by
the
athenian

driven
out

by
cleomen
of
lacedaemon
and
an
athenian
faction

the
live
were
driven
out

and
the
bone
of

were
taken
up

thus
they
were
cast
out

for
all
that

they
came
back
afterward

and
their

this

then
was
the
curs
that
the
lacedaemonian
order
them
to
drive
out

they
were
actuat
primarili

as
they
pretend

by
a
care
for
the
honour
of

but
they
also
know
that
pericl

son
of
xanthippus

was
connect
with
the

side

and
they
thought
that
his

would
materi
advanc

design
on

not
that
they
realli
hope
to
succeed
in
procur
this

they
rather
thought
to
creat
a
prejudic
against

in
the
eye
of
his
countrymen
from
the
feel
that
the
war
would
be

for
be
the
most

man
of

and
the
lead
athenian
statesman

he
oppos
the
lacedaemonian
in
everyth

and
would
have
no
concess

but
ever
urg
the
athenian
on
to

the
athenian
retort
by
order
the
lacedaemonian
to
drive
out
the
curs
of
taenarus

the
lacedaemonian
had
onc
rais
up
some
helot
suppliant
from
the
templ
of
poseidon
at
taenarus

led
them
away
and
slain
them

for
which
they
believ
the
great
earthquak
at
sparta
to
have
been
a
retribut

the
athenian
also
order
them
to
drive
out
the
curs
of
the

of
the
brazen

the
histori
of
which
is
as

after

the
lacedaemonian
had
been
recal

from
his

this
is
his
first
recal


and
had
been
tri
by

and
acquit

not
be

sent

he
took

on

without

arriv

first
enabl
him
to

some

been
taken

he
had

so
violent
a

upon

there

athenian

which
i
hold

and
that
is
the
principl
of
no

i
know
that
the

inspir

is

that

i

now
as

almost

the

i
put
it
to

to

now
it
was
clear
befor
that

it

the

never

never

accept
from

ani
such

on
the

they
wish
complaint
to
be
settl
by

instead
of
by

and
in
the
end
we
find
them
here
drop
the

adopt
that

they
order
us

to

of

than

familiar

they

through

it
must
be

that

if

be

but
in

by
this
mean
we
are
alway
a
match
for

and

best
of
all

we
have
a
larger
and
higher
class
of
nativ
coxswain
and
sailor
among

than
all
the
rest
of

and
to
say
noth
of
the
danger
of
such
a

none
of
our

would
consent
to
becom
an

from
his

and
to
take
servic
with
them
and
their
hope

for
the
sake
of
a
few
day

high
pay



this

i
think

is
a
toler
fair
account
of
the
posit
of
the
peloponnesian

that
of
athen
is
free
from
the
defect
that
i
have
critic
in
them

and
has
other
advantag
of
it
own

which
they
can
show
noth
to
equal

if
they
march
against
our
countri
we
will
sail
against
their

and
it
will
then
be
found
that
the
desol
of
the
whole
of
attica
is
not
the
same
as
that
of
even
a
fraction
of
peloponnes

for
they
will
not
be
abl
to
suppli
the
defici
except
by
a
battl

while
we
have

the

is
inde
a

consid
for

suppos
that
we
were

can
you
conceiv
a
more
impregn
posit

well

this
in
futur
should

as
far
as
possibl

be
our
concept
of
our
posit

dismiss
all
thought
of
our

and

we
must
vigil
guard
the

and
the

no

that
we
may

provok
us
to

a

would
onli
be

by
anoth
battl
against
the

a
revers
involv
the
loss
of

the
sourc
of
our

who
will
not
remain
quiet
a

after
we
becom
unabl

we
must
cri
not
over
the
loss
of
hous
and

but
of

sinc
hous
and

do
not
gain

but
men
them

and
if
i
had
thought
that
i
could
persuad
you

i
would
have
bid
you
go
out
and
lay
them
wast
with
your
own
hand

and
show
the
peloponnesian
that
this
at
ani
rate
will
not
make
you
submit



i
have
mani
other
reason
to
hope
for
a
favour

if
you
can
consent
not

and
will
abstain
from

yourselv
in

inde

i
am
more
afraid
of
our

blunder
than
of
the
enemi

devic

but
these
matter
shall
be
explain
in
anoth
speech

as
event
requir

for
the
present
dismiss
these
men
with
the
answer
that
we
will
allow
megara
the
use
of
our
market
and
harbour

when
the
lacedaemonian
suspend
their
alien
act
in
favour
of
us
and
our
alli

there
be
noth
in
the
treati
to
prevent
either
one
or
the
other

that
we
will
leav
the
citi
independ

if
independ
we
found
them
when
we
made
the
treati

and
when
the
lacedaemonian
grant
to
their
citi
an
independ
not
involv
subservi
to
lacedaemonian
interest

but
such
as
each
sever
may
desir

that
we
are
will
to
give
the
legal
satisfact
which
our
agreement
specifi

and
that
we
shall
not
commenc
hostil

but
shall
resist
those
who
do
commenc
them

this
is
an
answer
agreeabl
at
onc
to
the
right
and
the
digniti
of
athen

it
must
be
thorough
understood
that
war
is
a
necess

but
that
the
more
readili
we
accept
it

the
less
will
be
the
ardour
of
our
oppon

and
that
out
of
the
greatest

individu
acquir
the
greatest

did
not
our

resist
the
mede
not
onli
with

our

but
even
when
those
resourc
had
been
abandon

and
more
by
wisdom
than
by
fortun

more
by
dare
than
by
strength

did
not
they
beat
off
the
barbarian
and
advanc
their
affair
to
their
present
height

we
must
not
fall
behind
them

but
must
resist
our
enemi
in
ani
way
and
in
everi
way

and
attempt
to
hand
down
our
power
to
our
poster
unimpair



such
were
the
word
of
pericl

the
athenian

persuad
of
the
wisdom
of
his
advic

vote
as
he
desir

and
answer
the
lacedaemonian
as
he
recommend

both
on
the
separ
point
and
in
the
general

they
would
do
noth
on
dictat

but
were
readi
to
have
the
complaint
settl
in
a
fair
and
imparti

by
the
legal
method

which
the
term
of
the

prescrib

the

discov

the
mass
of
the

be
avers
to
revolt
from

at
all

they
resolv

of

they
thus
manag

join
each

without

go
through

in

they
place
wagon
without

to
serv

and
arrang
everyth
els
as

when
everyth
had
been

that
circumst
permit

they
watch
their
opportun
and
went
out
of
their
hous
against
the
enemi

it
was
still
night

though
daybreak
was
at
hand

in
daylight
it
was
thought
that
their
attack
would
be
met
by
men
full
of
courag
and
on
equal
term
with
their
assail

while
in
dark
it
would
fall
upon
panic
stricken
troop

who
would
also
be
at
a
disadvantag
from
their
enemi
s
knowledg
of
the
local

so
they
made
their
assault
at
onc

and
came
to
close
quarter
as
quick
as
they
could


the
theban

find
themselv
outwit

immedi
close
up
to
repel
all
attack
made
upon

twice
or
thrice
they
beat
back
their

but
the
men
shout
and
charg
them

the
women
and
slave
scream
and
yell
from
the
hous
and
pelt
them
with
stone
and
tile

besid

it
had
been
rain
hard
all
night

and
so
at
last
their
courag
gave
way

and
they
turn
and
fled
through
the
town

most
of
the
fugit
were
quit
ignor
of
the
right

out

and
this

with
the
mud

and
the
dark
caus
by

be
in
her
last
quarter

and
the
fact
that
their
pursuer
knew
their
way
about
and
could
easili
stop
their
escap

prove
fatal
to
mani

the
onli
gate
open
was
the
one
by
which
they
had
enter

and
this
was
shut
by
one
of
the
plataean
drive
the
spike
of
a
javelin
into
the

instead
of
the

so
that
even
here
there
was
no

of

they
were
now
chase
all
over

some
got

threw

with

find

and
obtain
an

from
a

cut
through

right

the

see
their

now
consult
whether

just

or
whether
there
was

they
at

form
a

almost
befor

and
becom

for

sent
a

reproach
them
for

and
warn

they

ad

on

they

this
is
the

they
say
that

on

the

also
urg
his

argument
for

the

listen
to

and
began
to
carri
in

children
from

and
all
their

furnitur

even
to

which
they
took

their

and
cattl
they
sent
over

but
they
found
it
hard
to
move

as
most
of
them
had
been
alway
use
to
live
in
the
countri


from
veri
earli
time
this
had
been
more
the
case
with
the
athenian
than
with
other

under
cecrop
and
the
first
king

down
to
the
reign
of
theseus

attica
had
alway
consist
of
a
number
of

township

each
with

except
in

of

the

they
carri
on

settl
their

without

sometim
even
they
wage

against

as
in
the
case
of
the
eleusinian
with
eumolpus
against
erechtheus

in
theseus

howev

they
had
a
king
of
equal
intellig
and
power

and
one
of
the
chief
featur
in
his
organ
of
the

was
to
abolish
the

chamber
and

of

to

in

council

of

individu
might
still
enjoy
their

just
as
befor

but
they
were
henceforth
compel
to
have
onli
one
polit
centr

viz


athen

which
thus
count
all
the
inhabit
of
attica
among
her
citizen

so
that
when
theseus
die
he
left
a
great
state
behind
him

indeed

from
him
date
the
synoecia

or
feast
of
union

which
is
paid
for
by
the
state

and
which
the
athenian
still
keep
in
honour
of
the
goddess

befor
this
the
citi
consist
of
the
present
citadel
and
the
district
beneath
it
look
rather
toward
the
south

this
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
the
templ
of
the
other
deiti

besid
that
of
athene

are
in
the
citadel

and
even
those
that
are
outsid
it
are
most
situat
in
this
quarter
of
the
citi

as
that
of
the
olympian
zeus

of
the
pythian
apollo

of

and
of

in

the

the

this

not

there

the

sinc
the

when

was

from

use

indeed

the
old
fashion
of
use
the

befor
marriag
and
for
other
sacr
purpos
is
still
kept
up

again

from
their
old
resid
in
that
quarter

the
citadel
is
still
known
among
athenian
as
the

the
athenian
thus
long

scatter

in

even
after
the

old

still
prevail

and
from
the
earli
time
down
to
the
present
war
most
athenian
still
live
in
the
countri
with
their
famili
and
household

and
were
consequ
not
at
all
inclin
to
move
now

especi
as
they
had
onli
just
restor
their

after
the

deep
was
their

and
discont
at
abandon
their

and
at
have
to
chang
their

of

and
to
bid
farewel
to
what
each
regard
as
his
nativ
citi


when
they
arriv
at
athen

though
a
few
had
hous
of
their
own
to
go
to

or
could
find
an
asylum
with
friend
or
relat

by
far
the
greater
number
had
to
take
up
their
dwell
in
the
part
of
the
citi
that
were
not
built
over
and
in
the
templ
and
chapel
of
the
hero

except
the
acropoli
and
the
templ
of
the
eleusinian
demet
and
such
other
place
as
were
alway
kept
close

the
occup
of
the
plot
of
ground
lie
below
the
citadel
call
the
pelasgian
had
been
forbidden
by
a
curs

and
there
was
also
an
omin
fragment
of
a
pythian
oracl
which
said


leav
the
pelasgian
parcel
desol

woe
worth
the
day
that
men
inhabit
it


yet
this
too
was
now
built
over
in
the
necess
of
the
moment

and
in
my
opinion

if
the
oracl
prove
true

it
was
in
the
opposit
sens
to
what
was
expect

for
the
misfortun
of
the
state
did
not
aris
from
the
unlaw
occup

but
the
necess
of
the
occup
from
the
war

and
though
the
god
did
not
mention
this

he
foresaw
that
it
would
be
an
evil
day
for
athen
in
which
the
plot
came
to
be
inhabit

mani
also
took
up
their
quarter
in
the
tower
of
the
wall
or
wherev
els
they
could

for
when
they
were
all
come
in

the
citi
prove
too
small
to
hold
them

though
afterward
they
divid
the
long
wall
and
a
great
part
of
piraeus
into
lot
and
settl
there

all
this
while
great
attent
was
be
given
to
the
war

the
alli
were
be
muster

and
an
armament
of
a
hundr
ship
equip
for
peloponnes

such
was
the
state
of
prepar
at
athen


meanwhil
the
armi
of
the
peloponnesian
was
advanc

the
first
town
they
came
to
in
attica
was
oeno

where
they
to
enter
the
countri

sit
down
befor
it

they
prepar
to
assault
the
wall
with
engin
and
otherwis

oeno

stand
upon
the
athenian
and
boeotian
border

was
of
cours
a
wall
town

and
was
use
as
a
fortress
by
the
athenian
in
time
of
war

so
the
peloponnesian
prepar
for
their
assault

and
wast
some
valuabl
time
befor
the
place

this
delay
brought
the
gravest
censur
upon
archidamus

even
dure
the
levi
of
the
war
he
had
credit
for
weak
and
athenian
sympathi
by
the
half
measur
he
had
advoc

and
after
the
armi
had
assembl
he
had
further
injur
himself
in
public
estim
by
his
loiter
at
the
isthmus
and
the
slow
with
which
the
rest
of
the
march
had
been
conduct

but
all
this
was
as
noth
to
the
delay
at
oeno

dure
this
interv
the
athenian
were
carri
in
their
properti

and
it
was
the
belief
of
the
peloponnesian
that
a
quick
advanc
would
have
found
everyth
still
out

had
it
not
been
for
his
procrastin

such
was
the
feel
of
the
armi
toward
archidamus
dure
the
sieg

but
he

it
is
said

expect
that
the
athenian
would
shrink
from
let
their
land
be
wast

and
would
make
their
submiss
while
it
was
still
uninjur

and
this
was
whi
he
wait


but
after
he
had
assault
oeno

and
everi
possibl
attempt
to
take
it
had
fail

as
no
herald
came
from
athen

he
at
last
broke
up
his
camp
and
invad
attica

this
was
about
eighti
day
after
the
theban
attempt
upon
plataea

just
in
the
middl
of
summer

when
the
corn
was
ripe

and
archidamus

son
of
zeuxi

king
of
lacedaemon

was
in
command

encamp
in
eleusi
and
the
thriasian
plain

they
began
their
ravag

and
put
to
flight
some
athenian
hors
at
a
place
call
rheiti

or
the
brook

they
then
advanc

keep
mount
aegaleus
on
their
right

through
cropia

until
they
reach
acharna

the
largest
of
the
athenian
deme
or
township

sit
down
befor
it

they
form
a
camp
there

and
continu
their
ravag
for
a
long
while


the
reason
whi
archidamus
remain
in
order
of
battl
at
acharna
dure
this
incurs

instead
of
descend
into
the
plain

is
said
to
have
been
this

he
hope
that
the
athenian
might
possibl
be
tempt
by
the
multitud
of
their
youth
and
the
unpreced
effici
of
their
servic
to
come
out
to
battl
and
attempt
to
stop
the
devast
of
their
land

accord

as
they
had
met
him
at
eleusi
or
the
thriasian
plain

he
tri
if
they
could
be
provok
to
a
salli
by
the
spectacl
of
a
camp
at
acharna

he
thought
the
place
itself
a
good
posit
for
encamp

and
it
seem
like
that
such
an
import
part
of
the
state
as
the
three
thousand
heavi
infantri
of
the
acharnian
would
refus
to
submit
to
the
ruin
of
their
properti

and
would
forc
a
battl
on
the
rest
of
the
citizen

on
the
other
hand

should
the
athenian
not
take
the
field
dure
this
incurs

he
could
then
fearless
ravag
the
plain
in
futur
invas

and
extend
his
advanc
up
to
the
veri
wall
of
athen

after
the
acharnian
had
lost
their
own
properti
they
would
be
less
will
to
risk
themselv
for
that
of
their
neighbour

and
so
there
would
be
divis
in
the
athenian
counsel

these
were
the
motiv
of
archidamus
for
remain
at
acharna


in
the
meanwhil

as
long
as
the
armi
was
at
eleusi
and
the
thriasian
plain

hope
were
still
entertain
of
it
not
advanc
ani
nearer

it
was
rememb
that
pleistoanax

son
of
pausania

king
of
lacedaemon

had
invad
attica
with
a
peloponnesian
armi
fourteen
year
befor

but
had
retreat
without

farther
than
eleusi
and

which
inde
prove
the
caus
of
his
exil
from
sparta

as
it
was
thought
he
had
been
bribe
to
retreat

but
when
they
saw
the
armi
at
acharna

bare
seven

they
lost
all

the

most

tell

it

well
that
it
should
be
deliv
at

of

for

i

by

also
shown

such

wish

in

of
a

individu

to

accord
as

for
it

it
is
even

to
convinc
your

that
you

speak
the

on

the

who

your

as

i
shall
begin
with
our

it
is
both
just
and
proper
that
they
should
have
the
honour
of
the
first
mention
on
an
occas
like
the
present

they
dwelt
in
the
countri
without
break
in
the
success
from
generat
to

and
hand
it
down
free
to
the
present
time
by
their
valour

and
if
our
more
remot
ancestor
deserv
prais

much
more
do
our

who
ad
to
their

the
empir
which

now
possess

and
spare
no
pain
to
be
abl
to
leav
their

to
us
of
the
present
generat

last

there
are
few
part
of
our
dominion
that
have
not
been
augment
by
those
of
us
here

who
are
still
more
or
less
in
the
vigour
of

while
the

has
been

us
with
everyth
that
can
enabl
her
to

on

that
part
of

which
tell
of
the

which
gave

our

or
of
the
readi
valour
with
which
either
we
or
our

stem
the

of

aggress

is
a
theme
too
familiar
to
my
hearer
for
me
to
dilat
on

and
i
shall
therefor
pass
it
by

but
what
was
the
road
by
which
we
reach
our
posit

what
the
form
of
govern
under
which
our

what
the

habit
out
of

it
sprang

these
are
question
which
i
may
tri
to
solv
befor
i
proceed
to
my
panegyr
upon
these
men

sinc
i
think
this
to
be
a
subject
upon
which
on
the
present
occas
a
speaker
may
proper
dwell

and
to
which
the
whole

whether

may
listen
with

our

if

not

in

i

that
as

i

that

plain
matter
of

the

alon
give
no

at

they

or
to
her

to

her

by

rather

the
admir
of

age
will
be
our

sinc
we
have
not
left
our
power
without

but
have
shown
it
by
mighti
proof

and
far
from
need
a
homer
for
our
panegyrist

or
other
of
his
craft
whose
vers
might
charm
for
the

onli
for
the

which

we

everi

of

and
everywher

whether
for

have

such
is
the
athen
for

these

nobli
fought

may
everi

indeed
if
i
have
dwelt
at
some
length
upon
the
charact
of
our

it
has
been
to
show
that
our
stake
in
the
struggl
is
not
the

as
their
who
have
no
such
bless
to
lose

and
also
that
the
panegyr
of
the
men
over
whom
i
am

might
be
by
definit
proof
establish

that
panegyr
is
now
in
a
great
measur
complet

for
the

that
i

onli
what
the
heroism
of

have
made
her

men
whose

unlik
that

if
a

it
is
to
be
found
in
their
close

and
this
not
onli
in

in
which
it
set
the
final
seal
upon
their
merit

but
also
in
those
in
which
it
gave
the
first
intim
of

for
there
is
justic
in
the
claim
that
steadfast
in
his
countri
s
battl
should
be
as
a
cloak
to
cover
a
man
s
other
imperfect

sinc
the
good
action
has
blot
out
the
bad

and
his
merit
as
a

more
than
outweigh
his
demerit
as
an

but
none
of
these
allow
either
wealth
with

prospect
of

to
unnerv
his
spirit

or
poverti
with
it
hope
of
a
day
of
freedom
and
rich
to
tempt
him
to
shrink
from
danger

no

hold
that
vengeanc
upon
their
enemi
was
more
to
be
desir
than
ani
person

and
reckon
this
to
be
the
most
glorious
of
hazard

they
joy
determin
to
accept
the
risk

to
make

of
their

to

in

choos
to

to

they
fled
onli
from

but
met

face
to

and
after
one
brief

while
at
the

of

escap

not

till

then

when

that

howev

there
was
no

peopl
in

were

these
symptom
were

after
which
the

soon
reach
the

and
produc
a

when

it
upset

and
discharg

of

in

and
break

into

what

by

who
plung

so

was
at

held
out
to
a

against

ravag

so
that
when
they
succumb

as
in
most
case

on
the
seventh
or
eighth
day
to
the
intern
inflamm

they
had
still
some
strength
in

but
if
they
pass
this
stage

and
the
diseas
descend
further
into
the

induc
a
violent
ulcer
there
accompani
by
sever
diarrhoea

this
brought
on
a

was
general
fatal

for

first
settl
in

ran
it
cours
from

through

and

even
where

it
still
left

as

next

pericl

who

held
the

opinion
as
in

march

howev

while
they
were
still
in

and
had
not

enter
the

land

he
had
prepar
an

of
a

ship
for
peloponnes

and
when
all
was
readi
put
out
to

on

he
took
four

and
then
for

also

when
this
athenian

put

they
left

in

arrive
at
epidaurus
in

they
ravag
most
of

even
had

in

howev
they

put

they

and
took

after

they
return

but
found

gone

no

dure
the

on

men
kept
die
of

both
in

in

indeed
it
was
actual
assert
that
the
departur
of

was
hasten
by
fear
of
the
disord

as
they
heard
from
desert
that
it
was
in

and
also
could
see
the

yet
in
this
invas
they
remain
longer

and
ravag
the

were
about

the

took

the

after
the
second
invas
of

a
chang
came
over
the

of
the

their

had
now
been
twice
laid
wast

and
war
and
pestil
at
onc
press
heavi
upon

they
began
to
find
fault
with

as
the
author
of

and
the
caus

all
their

and
becam
eager
to
come
to

with
lacedaemon

and
actual
sent
ambassador
thither

who
did
not

succeed
in

their
despair
was
now
complet
and
all
vent
itself
upon

when
he

exasper

of

from

angri
feel
to
a
calmer

more

state
of

he
accord
came
forward

spoke
as

i
was
not

i
have
been
the

as
i

i

and
of
protest
against
your

unreason
irrit

or

by

i
am
of
opinion
that
nation
great
is
more
for

advantag
of
privat
citizen

than
ani

well
be

a
man
may
be
person
ever
so
well
off

and
yet
if
his
countri
be
ruin
he
must
be
ruin
with
it

wherea
a
flourish
commonwealth
alway
afford
chanc
of
salvat
to
unfortun
individu

sinc
then
a
state
can
support
the
misfortun
of
privat
citizen

while
they
cannot
support
her

it
is
sure
the
duti
of
everi
one
to
be
forward
in
her
defenc

and
not
like
you
to
be
so
confound
with
your
domest
afflict
as
to
give
up
all
thought
of
the
common
safeti

and
to
blame
me
for
have
counsel
war
and
yourselv
for
have
vote
it

and
yet
if
you
are
angri
with
me

it
is
with
one
who

as
i
believ

is
second
to
no
man
either
in
knowledg
of
the
proper
polici

or
in
the
abil
to
expound
it

and
who
is
moreov
not
onli
a
patriot
but
an
honest
one

a
man
possess
that
knowledg
without
that
faculti
of
exposit
might
as
well
have
no
idea
at
all
on
the
matter

if
he
had
both
these
gift

but
no
love
for
his
countri

he
would
be
but
a
cold
advoc
for
her
interest

while
were
his
patriot
not
proof
against
briberi

everyth
would
go
for
a
price

so
that
if
you
thought
that
i
was
even
moder
distinguish
for
these
qualiti
when
you
took
my
advic
and
went
to
war

there
is
certain
no
reason
now
whi
i
should
be
charg
with
have
done
wrong



for
those
of
cours
who
have
a
free
choic
in
the
matter
and
whose
fortun
are
not
at
stake

war
is
the
greatest
of
folli

but
if
the
onli
choic
was
between
submiss
with
loss
of
independ

and
danger
with
the
hope
of
preserv
that
independ

in
such
a
case
it
is
he
who
will
not
accept
the
risk
that
deserv
blame

not
he
who
will

i
am
the
same
man
and

unexpect

within

the

and
put

the

has
certain
been
an

of

born

howev

as
you
are

citizen
of
a
great
state

and
brought
up

as
you
have
been

with
habit
equal
to
your

you
should
be
readi
to
face
the
greatest
disast
and
still
to
keep
unimpair
the
lustr
of
your

for
the
judgment
of

is
as
relentless
to
the
weak
that
fall

as
it
is
jealous
of

ceas
then
to

if
you
shrink
befor
the
exert
which
the

make
necessari

and
fear
that
after
all
they
may
not

you
know
the

by
which
i
have
often
demonstr
to

the
groundless
of

if
those
are
not

i
will
now
reveal
an

from
the
great
of
your

which
i
think
has
never

itself
to

which
i
never

and
which
has
so
bold
a

that
i
should
scarc
adventur

were
it
not

i
see
around

you
perhap
think
that
your
empir
extend
onli
over
your

i
will
declar
to
you
the
truth

the
visibl
field
of
action
has
two
part

land
and
sea

in
the
whole
of
one
of
these
you
are
complet
suprem

not
mere
as
far
as
you
use
it
at
present

but
also
to
what
further
extent
you
may
think
fit

in
fine

your
naval
resourc
are
such
that
your
vessel
may
go
where
they
pleas

without
the
king
or
ani
other
nation
on
earth
be
abl
to
stop
them

so
that
although
you
may
think
it
a
great
privat
to
lose
the
use
of
your
land
and
hous

still
you
must
see
that
this
power
is
someth
wide
differ

and
instead
of
fret
on
their
account

you
should
realli
regard
them
in
the
light
of
the
garden
and
other
accessori
that
embellish
a
great
fortun

and
as

in
comparison

of
littl

you
should
know
too
that
liberti
preserv
by
your

will
easili
recov
for

what
we

while

the

even
what
you

will
pass
from

your

receiv
these

not
from

but
from
themselv

did
not
let
slip
what
their

had
acquir

but
deliv
them
safe
to
you

and
in
this
respect
at
least
you
must
prove
yourselv
their
equal

rememb
that
to
lose
what
one
has
got
is
more
disgrac
than
to
be
balk
in
get

and
you
must
confront
your
enemi
not
mere
with
spirit
but
with
disdain

confid
inde
a
bliss
ignor
can
impart

ay

even
to
a

but
disdain
is
the
privileg
of
those
who

like

of

and
where
the

by
the

it

not

which
is

in

again

your

has
a
right

the

these
are
a
common
sourc
of
pride
to
you
all

and
you
cannot
declin
the
burden
of
empir
and
still
expect
to
share
it
honour

you
should
rememb
also
that
what
you
are
fight
against
is
not
mere
slaveri
as
an
exchang
for

but
also
loss
of

danger
from
the

incur
in

besid

to

no

possibl

if

is

to

somewhat
plain

a

to

perhap
was

but
to
let

is
unsaf

and
men

would

inde
the

would
be
the

if

for

unambiti

never

in

such

are
useless
to

though
they

but
you

this
was
the

and
do
not

still

rememb

that
if
your

in

it

becaus

even

in

still
it

that

these

of

in

and
ani
other
trial
that

and
not
to

but
to
answer
from
the
wall
that
it
was
imposs
for
them
to
do
as
the
lacedaemonian
propos

as
soon
as
he
had
receiv
this
answer

king
archidamus
proceed
first
to
make
a
solemn
appeal
to
the
god
and
hero
of
the
countri
in
word
follow


ye
god
and
hero
of
the
plataean
territori

be
my
wit
that
not
as
aggressor
origin

nor
until
these
had
first
depart
from
the
common
oath

did
we
invad
this
land

in
which
our
father
offer
you
their
prayer
befor
defeat
the
mede

and
which
you
made
auspici
to
the
hellen
arm

nor
shall
we
be
aggressor
in
the
measur
to
which
we
may
now
resort

sinc
we
have
made
mani
fair
propos
but
have
not
been
success

gracious
accord
that
those
who
were
the
first
to
offend
may
be
punish
for
it

and
that
vengeanc
may
be
attain
by
those
who
would
righteous
inflict
it



after
this
appeal
to
the
god
archidamus
put
his
armi
in
motion

first
he
enclos
the
town
with
a
palisad
form
of
the
fruit
tree
which
they
cut
down

to
prevent
further
egress
from
plataea

next
they
threw
up
a
mound
against
the
citi

hope
that
the
larg
of
the
forc
employ
would
ensur
the
speedi
reduct
of
the
place

they
accord
cut
down
timber
from
cithaeron

and
built
it
up
on
either
side

lay
it
like
lattic
work
to
serv
as
a
wall
to
keep
the
mound
from
spread
abroad

and
carri
to
it
wood
and
stone
and
earth
and
whatev
other
materi
might
help
to
complet
it

they
continu
to
work
at
the
mound
for
seventi
day
and
night
without
intermiss

be
divid
into
relief
parti
to
allow
of
some
be
employ
in
carri
while
other
took
sleep
and
refresh

the
lacedaemonian
offic
attach
to
each
conting
keep
the
men
to
the
work

but
the
plataean

observ
the
progress
of
the
mound

construct
a
wall
of
wood
and
fix
it
upon
that
part
of
the
citi
wall
against
which
the
mound
was
be
erect

and
built
up
brick
insid
it
which
they
took
from
the
neighbour
hous

the
timber
serv
to
bind
the
build
togeth

and
to
prevent
it
becom
weak
as
it
advanc
in
height

it
had
also
a
cover
of
skin
and
hide

which
protect
the
woodwork
against
the
attack
of
burn
missil
and
allow
the
men
to
work
in
safeti

thus
the
wall
was
rais
to
a
great
height

and
the
mound
opposit
made
no
less
rapid
progress

the
plataean
also
thought
of
anoth
expedi

they
pull
out
part
of
the
wall
upon
which
the
mound
abut

and
carri
the
earth
into
the
citi


discov
this
the
peloponnesian
twist
up
clay
in
wattl
of
reed
and
threw
it
into
the
breach
form
in
the
mound

in
order
to
give
it
consist
and
prevent
it
be
carri
away
like
the
soil

stop
in
this
way
the
plataean
chang
their
mode
of
oper

and
dig
a
mine
from
the
town
calcul
their
way
under
the
mound

and
began
to
carri
off
it
materi
as
befor

this
went
on
for
a
long
while
without
the
enemi
outsid
find
it
out

so
that
for
all
they
threw
on
the
top
their
mound
made
no
progress
in
proport

be
carri
away
from
beneath
and
constant
settl
down
in

vacuum

but
the
plataean

fear
that
even
thus
they
might
not
be
abl
to
hold
out
against
the
superior
number
of
the
enemi

had
yet
anoth

they
stop

and
start
at

of

insid
from
the
old
low
wall

built
a
new
one
in
the
form
of
a
crescent
run
in
toward
the
town

in
order
that
in
the
event
of
the
great
wall
be
taken
this
might
remain

and
the
enemi
have
to
throw
up
a
fresh
mound
against
it

and
as
they
advanc
within
might
not
onli
have
their
troubl
over
again

but
also
be
expos
to
missil
on
their
flank

while
rais
the
mound
the
peloponnesian
also
brought
up
engin
against
the
citi

one
of
which
was
brought
up
upon
the
mound
against
the
great
build
and
shook
down
a
good
piec
of

to
the
no

alarm
of
the
plataean

other
were
advanc
against
differ
part
of
the

but
were
lasso
and
broken
by
the
plataean

who
also
hung
up
great
beam
by
long
iron
chain
from
either
extrem
of
two
pole
laid
on
the
wall
and
project
over

drew

go

so
that
it
fell
with
a

and
snap
off

of
the

after
this
the
peloponnesian

find
that
their

effect
noth

and
that
their

was
met
by

with

burn
the

it

inde
they
thought
of

the

might
be
reduc
without

they
accord
brought
faggot

brushwood
and
threw
them
from

first
into

between
it

and
this
soon
becom
full

they
next
heap
the

up

as
they
could
reach
from

top

and
then
light
the

fire

the
consequ

at

such
was
the

the

at

who

embarrass
by

took

and
recov
those

had
been
disabl
close

taken

at

they
kill
some

took

on

the

which
went
down
off

was
the
lacedaemonian
timocr

who
kill
himself
when
the

was
sunk

and
was
cast
up
in

of

the
athenian
on

set
up

they
had
put

turn

and
pick
up
the

dead
that
were

gave
back
to

the

also
set
up

for

inflict

apprehens
of

the

which
were

thus
the

was
now
at

dispers
the

which
had
retir
to

and
the
crissaean

cnemus

brasida

and
the
other
peloponnesian
captain
allow
themselv
to
be
persuad
by
the
megarian
to
make
an
attempt
upon
piraeus

the
port
of
athen

which
from
her
decid
superior
at
sea
had
been
natur
left
unguard
and
open

their
plan
was
as
follow

the
men
were
each
to
take
their
oar

cushion

and
rowlock
thong

and

go
overland
from
corinth
to
the
sea
on
the
athenian
side

to
get
to
megara
as
quick
as
they
could

and
launch
forti
vessel

which
happen
to
be
in
the
dock
at
nisaea

to
sail
at
onc
to
piraeus

there
was
no
fleet
on
the
look
out
in
the
harbour

and
no
one
had
the
least
idea
of
the
enemi
attempt
a
surpris

while
an
open
attack
would

it
was
thought

never
be
deliber
ventur
on

or

if
in
contempl

would
be
speedili
known
at
athen

their
plan
form

the
next
step
was
to
put
it
in
execut

arrive
by
night
and
launch
the
vessel
from
nisaea

they
sail

not
to
piraeus
as
they
had
origin
intend

be
afraid
of
the
risk

besid
which
there
was
some
talk
of
a
wind
have
stop
them

but
to
the
point
of
salami
that
look
toward
megara

where
there
was
a
fort
and
a
squadron
of
three
ship
to
prevent
anyth

this
fort
they
assault

meanwhil
fire
signal
were
rais
to
alarm
athen

and
a
panic
ensu
there
as
serious
as
ani
that
occur
dure
the
war

the
idea
in
the
citi
was
that
the
enemi
had
alreadi
sail
into
piraeus

in
piraeus
it
was
thought
that
they
had
taken
salami
and
might
at
ani
moment
arriv
in
the
port

as
inde
might
easili
have
been
done
if
their
heart
had
been
a
littl
firmer

certain
no

would
have

them

as
soon
as

broke

the
athenian
assembl
in
full
forc

launch
their
ship

and
embark
in
hast
and
uproar
went
with
the
fleet
to

while
their
soldieri
mount

the
peloponnesian

on
becom
awar
of
the

after

the

as
it
was
a
long
while
sinc
they
had
been
launch

and
they
were
not
water
tight

arrive
at
megara

they
return
back
on
foot
to
corinth

the
athenian
find
them
no
longer
at
salami

sail
back
themselv

and
after
this
made
arrang
for

piraeus
more

the

those
who

are
favour
regard
by
those
who
receiv

in

otherwis
are
thought
less
well
of

through
be

nor
is
this
an
unfair
way
of

where
the

from

they
seced
are
at

in

sympathi

and
a
match
for
each

in

and
where
no

exist
for

but
with
us
and
the
athenian
this
was
not
the
case

and
no
one
need
think
the
wors
of
us
for
revolt
from
them
in
danger

after
have
been
honour
by
them
in

of
peac



justic
and
honesti
will
be
the
first
topic
of
our
speech

especi
as
we
are
ask
for
allianc

becaus
we
know
that
there
can
never
be
ani
solid
friendship
between
individu

or
union
between
communiti
that
is
worth
the
name

unless
the
parti
be
persuad
of
each

s
honesti

and
be
general
congeni
the
one
to
the

sinc
from
differ
in

spring
also
differ
in
conduct

between
ourselv
and
the
athenian
allianc
began

when
you
withdrew
from
the
median
war
and
they
remain
to
finish
the
busi

but
we
did
not
becom
alli
of
the
athenian
for
the
subjug
of
the
hellen

but
alli
of
the
hellen
for
their
liber
from
the
mede

and
as
long
as
the
athenian
led
us
fair
we
follow
them
loyal

but
when
we
saw
them
relax
their
hostil
to
the
mede

to
tri
to
compass
the
subject
of
the
alli

then
our
apprehens
began

unabl

howev

to
unit
and
defend
themselv

on
account
of
the
number
of
confeder
that
had
vote

all
the
alli
were
enslav

except
ourselv
and
the
chian

who
continu
to
send
our
conting
as
independ
and
nomin
free

trust
in
athen
as
a
leader

howev

we
could
no
longer
feel

judg
by
the
exampl
alreadi
given

it
be
unlik
that
she
would
reduc
our
fellow
confeder

and
not
do
the
same
by
us
who
were
left

if
ever
she
had
the
power



had
we
all
been
still
independ

we
could
have
had
more
faith
in
their
not
attempt
ani
chang

but
the
greater
number
be
their
subject

while
they
were
treat
us
as
equal

they
would
natur
chafe
under
this
solitari
instanc
of
independ
as
contrast
with
the
submiss
of
the
major

particular
as
they
daili
grew
more
power

and
we
more
destitut

now
the
onli
sure
basi
of
an
allianc
is
for
each
parti
to
be
equal
afraid
of
the
other

he
who
would
like
to
encroach
is
then
deter
by
the
reflect
that
he
will
not
have
odd
in
his
favour

again

if
we
were
left
independ

it
was
onli
becaus
they
thought
they
saw
their
way
to
empir
more
clear
by
specious
languag
and
by
the
path
of
polici
than
by
those
of
forc

not
onli
were
we
use
as
evid
that
power
who
had

like
themselv

would
not

sure

join
them
in
their
expedit

against
their
will

without
the
parti
attack
be
in
the
wrong

but
the
same
system
also
enabl
them
to
lead
the
stronger
state
against
the
weaker
first

and
so
to
leav
the
former
to
the
last

strip
of
their
natur
alli

and
less
capabl
of
resist

but
if
they
had
begun
with
us

while
all
the
state
still
had
their
resourc
under
their
own
control

and
there
was
a
centr
to
ralli
round

the
work
of
subjug
would
have
been
found
less
easi

besid
this

our
navi
gave
them
some
apprehens

it
was
alway
possibl
that
it
might
unit
with
you
or
with
some
other
power

and
becom
danger
to
athen

the
court
which
we
paid
to
their
common
and
it
leader
for
the
time
be
also
help
us
to
maintain
our
independ

howev

we
did
not
expect
to
be
abl
to
do
so
much
longer

if
this
war
had
not
broken
out

from
the
exampl
that
we
had
had
of
their
conduct
to
the
rest



how
then
could
we
put
our
trust
in
such
friendship
or
freedom
as
we
had
here

we
accept
each
other
against
our
inclin

fear
made
them
court
us
in
war

and
us
them
in
peac

sympathi

the
ordinari
basi
of
confid

had
it
place
suppli
by
terror

fear
have
more
share
than
friendship
in
detain
us
in
the
allianc

and
the
first
parti
that
should
be
encourag
by
the
hope
of
impun
was
certain
to
break
faith
with
the
other

so
that
to
condemn
us
for
be
the
first
to
break
off

becaus
they
delay
the
blow
that
we
dread

instead
of
ourselv
delay
to
know
for
certain
whether
it
will
be
dealt
or
not

is
to
take
a
fals
view
of
the
case

for
if
we
were
equal
abl
with
them
to
meet
their
plot
and
imit
their
delay

we
should
be
their
equal
and
should
be
under
no
necess
of
be
their
subject

but
the
liberti
of
offenc
be
alway
their

that
of
defenc
ought
clear
to
be
our



such

lacedaemonian
and
alli

are
the
ground
and
the
reason
of
our
revolt

clear
enough
to
convinc
our
hearer
of
the
fair
of
our
conduct

and
suffici
to
alarm
ourselv

and
to
make
us
turn
to
some
mean
of
safeti

this
we
wish
to
do
long
ago

when
we
sent
to
you
on
the
subject
while
the
peac
yet
last

but
were
balk
by
your
refus
to
receiv
us

and
now

upon
the
boeotian
invit
us

we
at
onc
respond
to
the
call

and
decid
upon
a
twofold
revolt

from
the
hellen
and
from
the
athenian

not
to
aid
the
latter
in
harm
the
former

but
to
join
in
their
liber

and
not
to
allow
the
athenian
in
the
end
to
destroy
us

but
to
act
in
time
against
them

our
revolt

howev

has
taken
place
prematur
and
without
prepar

a
fact
which
make
it
all
the
more
incumb
on
you
to
receiv
us
into
allianc
and
to
send
us
speedi
relief

in
order
to
show
that
you
support
your
friend

and
at
the
same
time
do
harm
to
your
enemi

you
have
an
opportun
such
as
you
never
had
befor

diseas
and
expenditur
have
wast
the
athenian

their
ship
are
either
cruis
round
your
coast

or
engag
in
blockad
us

and
it
is
not
probabl
that
they
will
have
ani
to
spare

if
you
invad
them
a
second
time
this
summer
by
sea
and
land

but
they
will
either
offer
no
resist
to
your
vessel

or
withdraw
from
both
our
shore

nor
must
it
be
thought
that
this
is
a
case
of
put
yourselv
into
danger
for
a
countri
which
is
not
your

lesbo
may
appear
far
off

but
when
help
is
want
she
will
be
found
near
enough

it
is
not
in
attica
that
the
war
will
be
decid

as
some
imagin

but
in
the
countri
by
which
attica
is
support

and
the
athenian
revenu
is
drawn
from
the
alli

and
will
becom
still
larger
if
they
reduc
us

as
not
onli
will
no
other
state
revolt

but
our
resourc
will
be
ad
to
their

and
we
shall
be
treat
wors
than
those
that
were
enslav
befor

but
if
you
will
frank
support
us

you
will
add
to
your
side
a
state
that
has
a
larg
navi

which
is
your
great
want

you
will
smooth
the
way
to
the
overthrow
of
the
athenian
by
depriv
them
of
their
alli

who
will
be
great
encourag
to
come
over

and
you
will
free
yourselv
from
the
imput
made
against
you

of
not
support
insurrect

in
short

onli
show
yourselv
as
liber

and
you
may
count
upon
have
the
advantag
in

respect

therefor

the

becom

will
result

in

the

toward

a

from

overland

he
pass

where
the
line
of

was
passabl

and
thus
enter
unperceiv

told

that

the

upon

took

laid

the

now
this

thus
to

the

they
put
into

in
the
erythraeid

about
seven
day
after
the

here
they
learn
the

and
began
to
consid

teutiaplus

an

address
them
as
follow



alcida
and
peloponnesian
who
share
with
me
the
command
of
this
armament

my
advic
is
to
sail
just
as
we
are
to
mitylen

befor
we
have
been
heard
of

we
may
expect
to
find
the
athenian
as
much
off
their
guard
as
men
general
are
who
have
just
taken
a
citi

this
will
certain
be
so
by
sea

where
they
have
no
idea
of
ani
enemi
attack
them

and
where
our
strength

as
it
happen

main
lie

while
even
their
land
forc
are
probabl
scatter
about
the
hous
in
the
careless
of
victori

if
therefor
we
were
to
fall
upon
them
sudden
and
in
the
night

i
have
hope

with
the
help
of
the
well
wisher
that
we
may
have
left
insid
the
town

that
we
shall
becom
master
of
the
place

let
us
not
shrink
from
the
risk

but
let
us
rememb
that
this
is
just
the
occas
for
one
of
the
baseless
panic
common
in
war

and
that
to
be
abl
to
guard
against
these
in
one
s
own
case

and
to
detect
the
moment
when
an
attack
will
find
an
enemi
at
this
disadvantag

is
what
make
a
success
general



these
word
of
teutiaplus
fail
to
move
alcida

some
of
the
ionian
exil
and
the
lesbian
with
the
expedit
began
to
urg
him

sinc
this
seem
too
danger

to
seiz
one
of
the
ionian
citi
or
the
aeolic
town
of
cyme

to
use
as
a
base
for
effect
the
revolt
of
ionia

this
was
by
no
mean
a
hopeless
enterpris

as
their
come
was
welcom
everywher

their
object
would
be
by
this
move
to
depriv
athen
of
her
chief
sourc
of
revenu

and
at
the
same
time
to
saddl
her
with
expens

if
she
chose
to
blockad
them

and
they
would
probabl
induc
pissuthn
to
join
them
in
the

howev

alcida
gave
this
propos
as
bad
a
recept
as
the

be
eager

sinc
he
had
come
too
late
for
mitylen

to
find
himself
back
in
peloponnes
as
soon
as
possibl


accord
he
put
out
from
embatum
and
proceed
along

and
touch
at
the
teian
town

myonnesus

there
butcher
most
of
the
prison
that
he
had
taken
on

upon

envoy
came
to
him
from

told

men
who
had
never
rais
a

and
who
were
not

alli

and
that
if
he
did
not
stop
he
would
turn
mani
more

into

than

into

alcida
agre

and
let
go
all
the

still
in

and
some
of
the
other
that
he
had
taken

the
inhabit

instead
of
fli
at

sight

rather
come
up
to

take
them
for

have
no

that
while
the
athenian
command
the
sea
peloponnesian

would
ventur
over

from

alcida
set

had
come
in

from

and
inde
from

as

was

great
fear
were
felt
that

coast
along

even
if

did
not

might
make
descent
in

plunder
the

now
the

have
seen

continu
the

then
find

was

they
move

at

by

the
most

came
forward
again

spoke
as
follow



i
have
often
befor

been
convinc
that
a

incap

and
never
more
so
than
by
your

in

of
mitylen

fear

be
unknown
to
you
in

you
feel
just

never

or
by

are
full
of

to

and
bring
you
no

for
your

entir
forget
that
your

a

and
your

whose

ensur
not
by
your
suicid
concess

but
by
the
superior
given
you
by
your
own
strength
and
not
their
loyalti

the
most
alarm
featur
in
the
case
is
the
constant
chang
of
measur
with
which
we
appear
to
be
threaten

and
our
seem
ignor

the
fact
that
bad

never

better
for

that

that
unlearn

more
servic

insubordin

that
ordinari

usual
manag
public

better

the
latter
are
alway
want
to
appear
wiser

and
to
overrul
everi
proposit
brought
forward

think
that
they
cannot
show
their

matter

and
by
such
behaviour
too
often
ruin
their

while
those
who
mistrust
their

content
to
be
less

the
law

and
less
abl
to
pick

and
be

for
myself

i
adher
to
my
former
opinion

and
wonder
at
those
who
have

of

and
who
are
thus
caus
a
delay
which
is
all
in

by

the

proceed
against
the

blunt

although
where
vengeanc
follow
most
close
upon
the

it
best
equal
it
and
most
ampli
requit
it

i
wonder
also
who
will
be
the
man
who
will
maintain
the
contrari

and
will
pretend
to
show
that
the
crime
of
the

and
our

such
a

must
plain
either
have
such

to
prove
that

has
been

in

the

take

the
person
to

are
you

in
order
to
keep
you
from
this

i
proceed
to
show
that
no
one
state
has
ever
injur
you
as
much
as
mitylen

i
can
make
allow
for
those
who
revolt
becaus
they
cannot
bear
our
empir

or
who
have
been
forc
to
do
so
by
the
enemi

but
for
those
who
possess
an
island
with
fortif

who
could
fear
our
enemi
onli
by

and
there
had
their
own

galley
to
protect
them

who
were
independ

held
in

highest
honour
by
you

to
act
as
these
have
done

this
is
not
revolt

revolt
impli

it
is
deliber

wanton
aggress

an
attempt
to
ruin
us
by

with
our
bitterest
enemi

a
wors
offenc
than
a

undertaken
on
their
own

the
acquisit
of
power

the
fate
of
those
of
their
neighbour
who
had
alreadi
rebel
and
had
been
subdu
was
no
lesson
to
them

their

could
not

from

blind

full

by

the
truth
is
that

in
most

it
is
safer

it

easier
for

one
may
say

to
stave

our
mistak
has
been

is

come
over

no

they
thought
it
safer

in

therefor

if

as

i

that

advic

in

you
must
be
wrong
in

howev

if

right
or
wrong

you
determin
to
rule

you
must
carri
out
your
principl
and
punish
the
mitylenian
as
your
interest
requir

or
els
you
must
give
up
your
empir
and
cultiv
honesti
without
danger

make
up
your

therefor

to
give
them
like
for
like

and
do
not
let
the
victim
who
escap
the
plot
be
more
insens
than
the
conspir
who
hatch
it

but
reflect
what
they
would
have
done
if
victori
over
you

especi
they
were
the
aggressor

it
is
they
who
wrong
their
neighbour
without
a
caus

that
pursu
their
victim
to
the
death

on
account
of
the
danger
which
they
forese
in
let
their
enemi
surviv

sinc
the
object
of
a
wanton
wrong
is
more
danger

if
he
escap

than
an
enemi
who
has
not
this
to
complain
of

do
not

therefor

be
traitor
to
yourselv

but
recal
as
near
as
possibl
the
moment
of
suffer
and
the
suprem
import
which
you
then
attach
to
their
reduct

and
now
pay
them
back
in
their
turn

without
yield
to
present
weak
or
forget
the
peril
that
onc
hung
over
you

punish
them
as
they
deserv

and
teach
your
other
alli
by
a
strike
exampl
that
the
penalti
of
rebellion
is
death

let
them
onc
understand
this
and
you
will
not
have
so
often
to
neglect
your
enemi
while
you
are
fight
with
your

be
either

what

it
would

for

when

we
trust
in

and
look

to
a
trial
more
agreeabl
to

the

to

had
no

the

in

we
consent

ourselv
were
you

and
you
onli

from
whom
we
thought
we
were
most
like
to
obtain
justic


and
not
other
person

as
is
now
the
case

as
matter
stand

we
are
afraid
that
we
have
been
doubli
deceiv

we
have
good
reason
to
suspect

not
onli
that
the
issu
to
be
tri
is
the
most
terribl
of
all

but
that
you
will
not
prove
imparti

if
we
may
argu
from
the
fact
that
no
accus
was
first
brought
forward
for
us
to
answer

but
we
had
ourselv
to
ask
leav
to
speak

and
from
the
question
be
put
so
short

that
a
true
answer
to
it
tell
against
us

while
a
fals
one
can
be
contradict

in
this
dilemma

our
safest

and
inde
our
onli
cours

seem
to
be
to
say
someth
at
all

place
as
we
are

we
could
scarc
be
silent
without
be
torment
by
the
damn
thought
that
speak
might
have
save
us

another
difficulti
that
we
have
to
encount
is
the
difficulti
of
convinc
you

were
we
unknown
to
each
other
we
might
profit
by
bring
forward
new
matter
with
which
you
were
unacquaint

as
it
is

we
can
tell
you
noth
that
you
do
not
know
alreadi

and
we
fear

not
that
you
have
condemn
us
in
your
own
mind
of
have
fail
in
our
duti
toward
you

and
make
this
our
crime

but
that
to
pleas
a
third
parti
we
have
to
submit
to
a
trial
the
result
of
which
is
alreadi
decid

nevertheless

we
will
place
befor
you
what
we
can
just
urg

not
onli
on
the
question
of
the
quarrel
which
the
theban
have
against

but
also
as
address
you
and
the
rest
of
the
hellen

and
we
will
remind
you
of
our
good
servic

and
endeavour
to
prevail
with
you



to
your
short
question

whether
we
have
done
the
lacedaemonian
and
alli
ani
servic
in
this
war

we
say

if
you
ask
us
as
enemi

that
to
refrain
from
serv
you
was
not
to
do
you
injuri

if
as
friend

that
you
are
more
in
fault
for
have
march
against
us

dure
the
peac

and
against
the
mede

we
act
well

we
have
not
now
been
the
first
to
break
the
peac

and
we
were
the
onli
boeotian
who
then
join
in
defend
against
the
mede
the
liberti
of
hella

although
an
inland
peopl

we
were
present
at
the
action
at
artemisium

in
the
battl
that
took
place
in
our
territori
we
fought
by
the
side
of
yourselv
and
pausania

and
in
all
the
other
hellen
exploit
of
the
time
we
took
a
part
quit
out
of
proport
to
our
strength

besid

you

as
lacedaemonian

ought
not
to
forget
that
at
the
time
of
the
great
panic
at
sparta

after
the
earthquak

caus
by
the
secess
of
the
helot
to
ithome

we
sent
the
third
part
of
our
citizen
to
assist
you



on
these
great
and
histor
occas
such
was
the
part
that
we
chose

although
afterward
we
becam
your
enemi

for
this
you
were
to
blame

when
we
ask
for
your
allianc
against
our
theban
oppressor

you
reject
our
petit

and
told
us
to
go
to
the
athenian
who
were
our
neighbour

as
you
live
too
far
off

in
the
war
we
never
have
done
to
you

and
never
should
have
done
to
you

anyth
unreason

if
we
refus
to
desert
the
athenian
when
you
ask
us

we
did
no
wrong

they
had
help
us
against
the
theban
when
you
drew
back

and
we
could
no
longer
give
them
up
with
honour

especi
as
we
had
obtain
their
allianc
and
had
been
admit
to
their
citizenship
at
our
own
request

and
after
receiv
benefit
at
their
hand

but
it
was
plain
our
duti
loyal
to
obey
their
order

besid

the
fault
that
either
of
you
may
commit
in
your
supremaci
must
be
laid

not
upon
the
follow

but
on
the
chief
that
lead
them
astray



with
regard
to
the
theban

they
have
wrong
us
repeat

and
their
last
aggress

which
has
been
the
mean
of
bring
us
into
our
present
posit

is
within
your
own
knowledg

in
seiz
our
citi
in
time
of
peac

and
what
is
more
at
a
holi
time
in
the
month

they
just
encount
our
vengeanc

in
accord
with
the
univers
law
which
sanction
resist
to
an
invad

and
it
cannot
now
be
right
that
we
should
suffer
on
their
account

by
take
your
own
immedi
interest
and
their
animos
as
the
test
of
justic

you
will
prove
yourselv
to
be
rather
waiter
on
expedi
than
judg
of
right

although
if
they
seem
use
to
you
now

we
and
the
rest
of
the
hellen
gave
you
much
more
valuabl
help
at
a
time
of
greater
need

now
you
are
the
assail

and
other
fear
you

but
at
the
crisi
to
which
we
allud

when
the
barbarian
threaten
all
with
slaveri

the
theban
were
on
his
side

it
is
just

therefor

to
put
our
patriot
then
against
our
error
now

if
error
there
has
been

and
you
will
find
the
merit
outweigh
the
fault

and
display
at
a
junctur
when
there
were
few
hellen
who
would
set
their
valour
against
the
strength
of
xerx

and
when
greater
prais
was
their
who
prefer
the
danger
path
of
honour
to
the
safe
cours
of
consult
their
own
interest
with
respect
to
the
invas

to
these
few
we
belong

and
high
were
we
honour
for
it

and
yet
we
now
fear
to
perish
by
have
again
act
on
the
same
principl

and
chosen
to
act
well
with
athen
sooner
than
wise
with
sparta

yet
in
justic
the
same
case
should
be
decid
in
the
same
way

and
polici
should
not

anyth
els
than

gratitud
for
the

of

combin
with
a
proper
attent
to

consid
also
that
at

the

general
regard
you
as
a

of
worth
and
honour

and
if

pass
an

we

we
who
now
on

final

to

most

is

to

sinc
with
that
end
the
peril
of

in

we
say
that
we
did
not
surrend
our

to

to
that
we
would
have
prefer
inglori
starvat


but
trust
in

capitul
to

and
it
would
be
just

if
we
fail
to
persuad
you

to
put
us
back
in

and
let
us
take
the
chanc
that
fall
to

and
at

time
we
adjur
you
not
to
give
us
up

your
suppliant

lacedaemonian

out
of
your

and
faith

plataean
foremost
of
the
hellen
patriot

to
theban

our
most
hate
enemi

but
to
be
our
saviour

and
not

while
you
free
the
rest
of
the
hellen

to
bring
us
to
destruct



such
were
the
word
of
the
plataean

the
theban

afraid
that
the
lacedaemonian
might
be
move
by
what
they
had
heard

came
forward
and
said
that
they
too
desir
to
address
them

sinc
the
plataean
had

against
their
wish

been
allow
to
speak
at
length
instead
of
be
confin
to
a
simpl
answer
to
the
question

leav
be
grant

the
theban
spoke
as
follow



we
should
never
have
ask
to
make
this
speech
if
the
plataean
on
their
side
had
content
themselv
with
short
answer
the
question

and
had
not
turn
round
and
made
charg
against
us

coupl
with
a
long
defenc
of
themselv
upon
matter
outsid
the
present
inquiri
and
not
even
the
subject
of
accus

and
with
prais
of
what
no
one
find
fault
with

howev

sinc
they
have
done
so

we
must
answer
their
charg
and
refut
their
self
prais

in
order
that
neither
our
bad
name
nor
their
good
may
help
them

but
that
you
may
hear
the
real
truth
on
both
point

and
so
decid



the
origin
of
our
quarrel
was
this

we
settl
plataea
some
time
after
the
rest
of
boeotia

togeth
with
other
place
out
of
which
we
had
driven
the
mix
popul

the
plataean
not
choos
to
recogn
our
supremaci

as
had
been
first
arrang

but
separ
themselv
from
the
rest
of
the
boeotian

and
prove
traitor
to
their
nation

we
use
compuls

upon
which
they
went
over
to
the
athenian

and
with
them
did
as
much
harm

for
which
we
retali



next

when
the
barbarian
invad
hella

they
say
that
they
were
the
onli
boeotian
who
did
not
mediz

and
this
is
where
they
most
glorifi
themselv
and
abus
us

we
say
that
if
they
did
not
mediz

it
was
becaus
the
athenian
did
not
do
so
either

just
as
afterward
when
the
athenian
attack
the
hellen
they

the
plataean

were
again
the
onli
boeotian
who
atticiz

and
yet
consid
the
form
of
our
respect
govern
when
we
so
act

our
citi
at
that
junctur
had
neither
an
oligarch
constitut
in
which
all
the
nobl
enjoy
equal
right

nor
a
democraci

but
that
which
is
most
oppos
to
law
and
good
govern
and
nearest
a
tyranni

the
rule
of
a
close
cabal

these

hope
to
strengthen
their
individu
power
by
the
success
of
the
mede

kept
down
by
forc
the
peopl

and
brought
him
into
the
town

the
citi
as
a
whole
was
not
it
own
mistress
when
it
so
act

and
ought
not
to
be
reproach
for
the
error
that
it
commit
while
depriv
of
it
constitut

examin
onli
how
we
act
after
the
departur
of
the
mede
and
the
recoveri
of
the
constitut

when
the
athenian
attack
the
rest
of
hella
and
endeavour
to
subjug
our
countri

of
the
greater
part
of
which
faction
had
alreadi
made
them
master

did
not
we
fight
and
conquer
at
coronea
and
liber
boeotia

and
do
we
not
now
activ
contribut
to
the
liber
of
the
rest

provid
hors
to
the
caus
and
a
forc
unequal
by
that
of
ani
other
state
in
the
confederaci



let
this
suffic
to
excus
us
for
our
medism

we
will
now
endeavour
to
show
that
you
have
injur
the
hellen
more
than
we

and
are
more
deserv
of
condign
punish

it
was
in
defenc
against
us

say
you

that
you
becam
alli
and
citizen
of
athen

if
so

you
ought
onli
to
have
call
in
the
athenian
against
us

instead
of
join
them
in
attack
other

it
was
open
to
you
to
do
this
if
you
ever
felt
that
they
were
lead
you
where
you
did
not
wish
to
follow

as
lacedaemon
was
alreadi
your
alli
against
the
mede

as
you
so
much
insist

and
this
was
sure
suffici
to
keep
us
off

and
abov
all
to
allow
you
to
deliber
in
secur

nevertheless

of
your
own
choic
and
without
compuls
you
chose
to
throw
your
lot
in
with
athen

and
you
say
that
it
had
been
base
for
you
to
betray
your
benefactor

but
it
was
sure
far
baser
and
more
iniquit
to
sacrific
the
whole
bodi
of
the
hellen

your
fellow
confeder

who
were
liber
hella

than
the
athenian
onli

who
were
enslav
it

the
return
that
you
made
them
was
therefor
neither
equal
nor
honour

sinc
you
call
them
in

as
you
say

becaus
you
were
be
oppress
yourselv

and
then
becam
their
accomplic
in
oppress
other

although
base
rather
consist
in
not
return
like
for
like
than
in
not
return
what
is
just
due
but
must
be
unjust
paid



meanwhil

after
thus
plain
show
that
it
was
not
for
the
sake
of
the
hellen
that
you
alon
then
did
not
mediz

but
becaus
the
athenian
did
not
do
so
either

and
you
wish
to
side
with
them
and
to
be
against
the
rest

you
now
claim
the
benefit
of
good
deed
done
to
pleas
your
neighbour

this
cannot
be
admit

you
chose
the
athenian

and
with
them
you
must
stand
or
fall

nor
can
you
plead
the
leagu
then
made
and
claim
that
it
should
now
protect
you

you
abandon
that
leagu

and
offend
against
it
by
help
instead
of
hinder
the
subjug
of
the
aeginetan
and
other
of
it
member

and
that
not
under
compuls

but
while
in
enjoy
of
the

that
you
enjoy
to
the
present
hour

and
no

forc
you
as
in
our

last

an

was

to
you
befor
you
were
blockad
to

and
join
neither

this
you
did
not
accept

who
then
merit
the
detest

more
just

who
sought

under
the
mask
of

the
former
virtu
that
you
alleg
you
now
show
not
to
be
proper
to
your
charact

the
real
bent
of
your
natur
has
been
at
length
damn
prove

when
the
athenian
took
the
path
of
injustic
you
follow

the
last
wrong
wrong
of
which
you
complain
consist
in
our
have

as
you
say

lawless
invad
your
town
in
time
of
peac
and
festiv

here
again
we
cannot
think
that
we
were
more
in
fault
than
yourselv

if
of
our
own
proper
motion
we
made
an
arm
attack
upon
your
citi
and
ravag
your
territori

we
are
guilti

but
if
the
first
men
among
you
in
estat
and
famili

wish
to
put
an
end
to
the
foreign
connect
and
to
restor
you
to
the
common
boeotian
countri

of
their
own
free
will
invit
us

wherein
is
our
crime

where
wrong
is
done

those
who
lead

as
you
say

are
more
to
blame
than
those
who
follow

not
that

in
our
judgment

wrong
was
done
either
by
them
or
by
us

citizen
like
yourselv

and
with
more
at
stake
than
you

they
open
their
own
wall
and
introduc
us
into
their
own
citi

not
as
foe
but
as
friend

to
prevent
the
bad
among
you
from
becom
wors

to
give
honest
men
their
due

to
reform
principl
without
attack
person

sinc
you
were
not
to
be
banish
from
your
citi

but
brought
home
to
your
kindr

nor
to
be
made
enemi
to
ani

but
friend
alik
to
all



that
our
intent
was
not
hostil
is
prove
by
our
behaviour

we
did
no
harm
to
ani
one

but
public
invit
those
who
wish
to
live
under
a
nation

boeotian
govern
to
come
over
to
us

which
as
first
you
glad
did

and
made
an
agreement
with
us
and
remain
tranquil

until
you
becam
awar
of
the
small
of
our
number

now
it
is
possibl
that
there
may
have
been
someth
not
quit
fair
in
our
enter
without
the
consent
of
your
common

at
ani
rate
you
did
not
repay
us
in
kind

instead
of
refrain

as
we
had
done

from
violenc

and
induc
us
to
retir
by
negoti

you
fell
upon
us
in
violat
of
your
agreement

and
slew
some
of
us
in
fight

of
which
we
do
not
so
much
complain

for
in
that
there
was
a
certain
justic

but
other
who
held
out
their
hand
and
receiv
quarter

and
whose
live
you
subsequ
promis
us

you
lawless
butcher

if
this
was
not
abomin

what
is

and
after
these
three
crime
commit
one
after
the
other

the
violat
of
your
agreement

the
murder
of
the
men
afterward

and
the
lie
breach
of
your
promis
not
to
kill
them

if
we
refrain
from
injur
your
properti
in
the
countri

you
still
affirm
that
we
are
the
crimin
and
yourselv
pretend
to
escap
justic

not
so

if
these
your
judg
decid
aright

but
you
will
be
punish
for
all
togeth



such

lacedaemonian

are
the
fact

we
have
gone
into
them
at
some
length
both
on
your
account
and
on
our
own

that
you
may
fed
that
you
will
just
condemn
the
prison

and
we

that
we
have
given
an
addit
sanction
to
our
vengeanc

we
would
also
prevent
you
from
be
melt
by
hear
of
their
past
virtu

if
ani
such
they
had

these
may
be
fair
appeal
to
by
the
victim
of
injustic

but
onli
aggrav
the
guilt
of
crimin

sinc
they
offend
against
their
better
natur

nor
let
them
gain
anyth
by
cri
and
wail

by
call
upon
your
father

tomb
and
their
own
desol
condit

against
this
we
point
to
the
far
more
dread
fate
of
our
youth

butcher
at
their
hand

the
father
of
whom
either
fell
at
coronea

bring
boeotia
over
to
you

or
seat

forlorn
old
men
by
desol
hearth

with
far
more
reason
implor
your
justic
upon
the
prison

the
piti
which
they
appeal
to
is
rather
due
to
men
who
suffer
unworthili

those
who
suffer
just
as
they
do
are
on
the
contrari
subject
for
triumph

for
their
present
desol
condit
they
have
themselv
to
blame

sinc
they
wil
reject
the
better
allianc

their
lawless
act
was
not
provok
by
ani
action
of
our

hate

not
justic

inspir
their
decis

and
even
now
the
satisfact
which
they
afford
us
is
not
adequ

they
will
suffer
by
a
legal
sentenc

not
as
they
pretend
as
suppliant
ask
for
quarter
in
battl

but
as
prison
who
have
surrend
upon

to
take
their

vindic

therefor

which
they
have
broken

by
our

nor
let
us
be
supplant
in
your

by

but
offer
an
exampl
to
the

that
the
contest
to
which
you
invit
them
are
of

not

good

where

a

and
thus
made

repli


then
they

not
the

the

yes

they

you

indeed

this
was
by

the
greatest
disast
that
befel

that

to

our

overaw
by

one
of

is
the
awkward
of
the

this

howev

onli
help
us
if

our

if

it
will
be

enough

in

without

suppos
that
we
succeed
in

him

which
we
shall
find
it
easier
to

than
after

on

these
need
not

you

of

you

employ
your

so

to
keep
what
you
have

you
can

led
on

those

have
also
just
least
faith
in

and
to
teach
your

our
this

experi
has
not

want



to
be
convinc
of
this
you
have
onli
to
look
at
our

what
power
in

stood
higher
than
we
did

and
yet
we
are
come
to
you

although
we
former
thought
ourselv
more
abl
to
grant
what
we
are
now
here
to
ask

nevertheless

we
have
not
been
brought
to
this
by
ani
decay
in
our
power

or
through
have
our
head
turn
by
aggrandiz

no

our
resourc
are
what
they
have
alway
been

and
our
error
has
been
an
error
of
judgment

to
which
all
are
equal
liabl

accord

the
prosper
which
your

now
enjoy

and
the
access
that
it
has
late
receiv

must
not
make
you
fanci
that
fortun
will
be
alway
with
you

indeed
sensibl
men
are
prudent
enough
to
treat
their
gain
as
precari

just
as
they
would
also
keep
a
clear
head
in

and
think
that
war

so
far
from

within
the
limit
to
which
a

it

will
run
the
cours
that
it
chanc
prescrib

and
thus

not
be
puf
up
by
confid
in

success

they
are
less
like
to
come
to
grief

and
most
readi
to
make
peac

if
they
can

while
their

last

this

athenian

you
have
a
good
opportun
to
do
now
with

and
thus
to

the
possibl
disast
which
may
follow
upon

and
the

of

owe
to

when
you
might
have
left
behind
you
a

and

which
noth
could

the
lacedaemonian
accord
invit
you
to
make
a

and
to
end
the

and
offer
peac
and
allianc
and
the
most
friend
and
intim
relat
in
everi
way
and
on
everi
occas
between
us

and
in
return
ask
for
the
men
on

think
it
better
for
both
parti
not
to
stand
out
to

end

on
the
chanc
of
some
favour
accid
enabl
the
men
to
forc
their

out

or
of

compel
to
succumb
under
the
pressur
of
blockad

indeed
if
great
enmiti
are
ever
to
be
realli
settl

we
think
it
will
be

not
by
the
system
of
reveng
and
militari
success

and
by
forc
an
oppon
to
swear
to
a
treati
to
his
disadvantag

but
when
the
more
fortun
combat
waiv
these
his
privileg

to
be
guid
by
gentler
feel
conquer
his
rival
in
generos

and
accord
peac
on
more
moder
condit
than
he
expect

from
that
moment

instead
of
the
debt
of
reveng
which
violenc
must
entail

his
adversari
owe
a
debt
of
generos
to
be
paid
in
kind

and
is
inclin
by
honour
to
stand
to
his
agreement

and
men
often
act
in
this
manner
toward
their
greatest
enemi
than
where
the
quarrel
is
of
less
import

they
are
also
by
natur
as
glad
to
give
way
to
those
who
first
yield
to
them

as
they
are
apt
to
be
provok
by
arrog
to
risk
condemn
by
their
own
judgment



to
appli
this
to
ourselv

if
peac
was
ever
desir
for
both
parti

it
is
sure
so
at
the
present
moment

befor
anyth
irremedi
befal

forc
us
to
hate

person
as

you
to

that
we
now
offer

while
the
issu
is
still
in

and
you
have
reput

our

in

and
we
the
compromis
of
our
misfortun
befor
anyth
fatal
occur

let
us
be
reconcil

and
for
ourselv
choos
peac
instead
of
war

and
grant
to
the
rest
of
the
hellen
a
remiss
from
their
suffer

for
which
be
sure
they
will
think
they
have
chiefli
you
to
thank

the
war
that
they
labour
under
they
know
not
which
began

but
the
peac
that
conclud
it

as
it
depend
on
your

will
by
their
gratitud
be
laid
to
your

by
such
a
decis
you
can
becom
firm
friend
with
the
lacedaemonian
at
their
own
invit

which
you
do
not
forc
from

but
oblig
them

from

the
advantag
that

the

such

the

the

the

the

it

not

my
citi
is
the
least
in

the
greatest
suffer

but
in
order
to
state
public
what
appear
to
me
to
be
the
best
polici
for
the
whole
island

that
war
is
an
evil
is
a
proposit
so
familiar
to
everi
one
that
it
would
be
tedious
to
develop
it

no
one
is
forc
to
engag
in
it
by
ignor

or
kept
out
of
it
by
fear

if
he
fanci
there
is
anyth
to

gain
by
it

to
the
former
the
gain
appear
greater
than
the
danger

while
the
latter
would
rather
stand
the
risk
than
put
up

but
if
both
should
happen
to
have
chosen
the

for
act
in
this

advic
to
make
peac
would
not
be
unservic

and
this

if
we
did
but
see
it

is
just
what
we
stand
most
in
need
of
at
the
present
junctur



i
suppos
that
no
one
will
disput
that
we
went
to
war
at
first
in
order
to
serv
our
own
sever
interest

that
we
are
now

in
view
of
the
same
interest

debat
how
we
can
make
peac

and
that
if
we
separ
without
have
as
we
think
our
right

we
shall
go
to
war
again

and
yet

as
men
of
sens

we
ought
to
see
that
our
separ
interest
are
not
alon
at
stake
in
the
present
congress

there
is
also
the
question
whether
we
have
still
time
to
save
sicili

the
whole
of
which
in
my
opinion
is
menac
by
athenian
ambit

and
we
ought
to
find
in
the
name
of
that
peopl
more
imperi
argument
for
peac
than
ani
which
i
can
advanc

when
we
see
the
first
power
in
hella
watch
our
mistak
with
the
few
ship
that
she
has
at
present
in
our
water

and
under
the
fair
name
of
allianc
specious
seek
to
turn
to
account
the
natur
hostil
that
exist
between
us

if
we
go
to
war

and
call
in
to
help
us
a
peopl
that
are
readi
enough
to
carri
their
arm
even
where
they
are
not
invit

and
if
we
injur
ourselv
at
our
own
expens

and
at
the
same
time
serv
as
the
pioneer
of
their
dominion

we
may
expect

when
they
see
us
worn
out

that
they
will
one
day
come
with
a
larger
armament

and
seek
to
bring
all
of
us
into
subject



and
yet
as
sensibl
men

if
we
call
in
alli
and
court
danger

it
should
be
in
order
to
enrich
our
differ
countri
with
new
acquisit

and
not
to
ruin
what
they
possess
alreadi

and
we
should
understand
that
the
intestin
discord
which
are
so
fatal
to
communiti
general

will
be
equal
so
to
sicili

if
we

it
inhabit

absorb
in
our
local
quarrel

neglect
the
common
enemi

these
consider
should
reconcil
individu
with
individu

and
citi
with
citi

and
unit
us
in
a
common
effort
to
save
the
whole
of
sicili

nor
should
ani
one
imagin
that
the
dorian
onli
are
enemi
of
athen

while
the
chalcidian
race
is
secur
by
it
ionian
blood

the
attack
in
question
is
not
inspir
by
hatr
of
one
of
two
nation

but
by
a
desir
for
the
good
thing
in
sicili

the
common
properti
of
us
all

this
is
prove
by
the
athenian
recept
of
the
chalcidian
invit

an
alli
who
has
never
given
them
ani
assist
whatev

at
onc
receiv
from
them
almost
more
than
the
treati
entitl
him
to

that
the
athenian
should
cherish
this
ambit
and
practis
this
polici
is
veri
excus

and
i
do
not
blame
those
who
wish
to
rule

but
those
who
are
over
readi
to
serv

it
is
just
as
much
in
men
s
natur
to
rule
those
who
submit
to
them

as
it
is
to
resist
those
who
molest
them

one
is
not
less
invari
than
the
other

meanwhil
all
who
see
these
danger
and
refus
to
provid
for
them
proper

or
who
have
come
here
without
have
made
up
their
mind
that
our
first
duti
is
to
unit
to
get
rid
of
the
common
peril

are
mistaken

the
quickest
way
to
be
rid
of
it
is
to
make
peac
with
each
other

sinc
the
athenian
menac
us
not
from
their
own
countri

but
from
that
of
those
who
invit
them
here

in
this
way
instead
of

issu
in

peac
quiet
end
our

and
the

who

under

for

will
have
good

go
away
without

so
far
as

the
athenian

such
are
the
great
advantag
prove
inher

a
wise
polici

independ
of
this

in
the

of
the
univers
consent

that
peac
is
the
first
of

how
can
we
refus
to
make
it
amongst
ourselv

or
do
you
not
think
that
the
good
which
you
have

and
the
ill
that
you
complain
of

would
be
better
preserv
and
cure
by
quiet
than
by

that
peac
has
it
honour
and
splendour
of
a

kind

not
to
mention
the
numer
other
bless
that
one
might
dilat

with
the
not

of

these
consider
should
teach
you
not
to

rather
to
look
in

everi

for

the

think
this

than
the

it
was
accord

take

to

form

that
after

to

the

both

sail
by

the

off

with

place

which
was

no

knew

except
those
whose
busi
it
was
to
know
that
night

a
littl
befor
daybreak

the

in

began
to
act

everi
night
for
a
long
time
back

under
pretenc
of
maraud

in
order
to
have
a
mean
of
open
the

they
had
been
use

with
the
consent
of
the

to
carri
by
night
a
scull
boat
upon
a
cart
along

and
so
to
sail
out

bring
it
back
again
befor
day
upon
the
cart

and
take
it
within
the
wall
through
the
gate

in
order

as
they
pretend

to
baffl
the
athenian
blockad
at
minoa

there
be
no
boat
to
be
seen
in
the
harbour

on
the
present
occas
the
cart
was
alreadi
at
the
gate

which
had
been
open
in
the
usual
way
for
the
boat

when
the
athenian

with
whom
this
had
been
concert

saw
it

and
ran
at
the
top
of
their
speed
from
the
ambush
in
order
to
reach
the
gate
befor
they
were
shut
again

and
while
the
cart
was
still
there
to
prevent
their

close

their
megarian
accomplic
at
the
same
moment
kill
the
guard
at

the
first
to
run
in
was
demosthen
with
his
plataean
and
peripoli

just
where
the
trophi
now
stand

and
he
was
no
sooner
within
the
gate
than
the
plataean
engag
and
defeat
the
nearest
parti
of
peloponnesian
who
had
taken
the

and
come
to
the
rescu

and
secur
the

athenian
heavi

after
this

each
of
the
athenian
as
fast
as
they
enter
went
against
the

a
few
of
the
peloponnesian
garrison
stood
their
ground
at
first

and
tri
to
repel
the
assault

and
some
of
them
were
kill

but
the
main
bodi
took
fright
and
fled

the
night
attack
and
the
sight
of
the
megarian
traitor
in
arm
against
them
make
them
think
that
all
megara
had
gone
over
to
the

it
so
happen
also
that
the
athenian
herald
of
his
own
idea
call
out
and
invit
ani
of
the
megarian
that
wish

to
join
the
athenian
rank

and
this
was
no
sooner
heard
by
the
garrison
than
they
gave
way

and

convinc
that
they
were
the
victim
of
a
concert
attack

took
refug
in
nisaea

by

taken

was
privi

plot

said
that
they
ought
to
open
the
gate
and
march
out
to

it
had
been
concert
between
them
that
the
athenian
should
rush
in

the

that

were
open

while
the
conspir
were
to

and
so
to
avoid
be
hurt

they
could
open
the

with
more
secur

four
thousand
athenian
heavi
infantri
from
eleusi

and
six
hundr
hors

had
march
all

and
were
now
close

the

were
all
readi
anoint

when
one
of
their

denounc

with

they

thus
in

he
perform

it
had
been

of

in

upon

might

it

be
divert

ask
for

to

the
lacedaemonian
were
also
glad
to
have
an
excus

for

that
the

the
object
be
to

as
it
was

that
the

would
be
the
most

the
most

as

disregard

for

them
as

acanthian

the
lacedaemonian
have
sent
out
me
and
my
armi
to
make
good
the
reason
that
we
gave
for
the
war
when
we
began
it

viz


that
we
were
go
to
war
with
the
athenian
in
order
to
free
hella

our
delay
in
come
has
been
caus
by
mistaken
expect
as
to
the
war
at
home

which
led
us
to
hope

by
our
own
unassist
effort
and
without
your
risk
anyth

to
effect
the
speedi
downfal
of
the
athenian

and
you
must
not
blame
us
for
this

as
we
are
now
come
the
moment
that
we
were
abl

prepar
with
your
aid
to
do
our
best
to
subdu
them

meanwhil
i
am
astonish
at
find
your
gate
shut
against
me

and
at
not
meet
with
a
better
welcom

we
lacedaemonian
thought
of
you
as
alli
eager
to
have
us

to
whom
we
should
come
in
spirit
even
befor
we
were
with
you
in
bodi

and
in
this
expect
undertook
all
the
risk
of
a
march
of
mani
day
through
a
strang
countri

so
far
did
our
zeal
carri
us

it
will
be
a
terribl
thing
if
after
this
you
have
other
intent

and
mean
to
stand
in
the
way
of
your
own
and
hellen
freedom

it
is
not
mere
that
you
oppos
me
yourselv

but
wherev
i
may
go
peopl
will
be
less
inclin
to
join
me

on
the
score
that
you

to
whom
i
first
came

an
import
town
like
acanthus

and
prudent
men
like
the
acanthian

refus
to
admit
me

i
shall
have
noth
to
prove
that
the
reason
which
i
advanc
is
the
true
one

it
will
be
said
either
that
there
is
someth
unfair
in
the
freedom
which
i
offer

or
that
i
am
in
insuffici
forc
and
unabl
to
protect
you
against
an
attack
from
athen

yet
when
i
went
with
the
armi
which
i
now
have
to
the
relief
of
nisaea

the
athenian
did
not
ventur
to
engag
me
although
in
greater
forc
than
i

and
it
is
not
like
they
will
ever
send
across
sea
against
you
an
armi
as
numer
as
they
had
at
nisaea

and
for
myself

i
have
come
here
not
to
hurt
but
to
free
the
hellen

wit
the
solemn
oath
by
which
i
have
bound
my
govern
that
the
alli
that
i
may
bring
over
shall
be
independ

and
besid
my
object
in
come
is
not
by
forc
or
fraud
to
obtain
your
allianc

but
to
offer
you
mine
to
help
you
against
your
athenian
master

i
protest

therefor

against
ani
suspicion
of
my
intent
after
the
guarante
which
i
offer

and
equal
so
against
doubt
of
my
abil
to
protect
you

and
i
invit
you
to
join
me
without
hesit



some
of
you
may
hang
back
becaus
they
have
privat
enemi

and
fear
that
i
may
put
the
citi
into
the
hand
of
a
parti

none
need
be
more
tranquil
than
they

i
am
not
come
here
to
help
this
parti
or
that

and
i
do
not
consid
that
i
should
be
bring
you
freedom
in
ani
real
sens

if
i
should
disregard
your
constitut

and
enslav
the
mani
to
the
few
or
the
few
to
the
mani

this
would
be
heavier
than
a
foreign
yoke

and
we
lacedaemonian

instead
of
be
thank
for
our
pain

should
get
neither
honour
nor
glori

but

contrariwis

reproach

the
charg
which
strengthen
our
hand
in
the
war
against
the
athenian
would
on
our
own
show
be
merit
by
ourselv

and
more
hate
in
us
than
in
those
who
make
no
pretens
to
honesti

as
it
is
more
disgrac
for
person
of
charact
to
take
what
they
covet
by
fair
seem
fraud
than
by
open
forc

the
one
aggress
have
for
it
justif
the

which
fortun
give

the

be
simpli
a
piec

a

thus

we
natur
look
to

and
over

abov
the

that

what
stronger
assur
can
you
have

when
you

that
our
word

compar
with
the
actual
fact

produc
the
necessari
convict
that
it
is

to

if
to

you
put
in
the
plea
of

and
claim
that
your

should
save
you
from

that

in

and
that
it
is
right
to

it
to
those
who
can
accept

but
not

in

through

the

is
one
which

of

your

it

to
annoy
boeotia
that

on

that
they
had
done
wrong
in
transgress
the

of

of

if

the

never

accord

invit
them
first
to
evacu
the

if
they
wish
to
take
up
the

that
belong
to

after
these
word
from
the

the
athenian
sent
their

to
the
boeotian
to
say
that
they
had
not
done

for

would

no

but
to
defend
themselv
from

against
those
who
were
realli
wrong
them

the
law
of

was
that
conquest

whether
more

extens

carri
with

with

at

this
would
have
been
the

with

as

the

they
stood
where

all
that

their

was

more

to

had
been
wrong
by

ani
opposit
that
they

could
be

have
encourag

with

made

the
athenian
defend
themselv
from
a

from

one

they
beat

the

the

they
could

meanwhil
the

put

carri
up

sudden
broke
down
with

loud
crash

at
which
the
men
who
were
near
and
saw
it
were
more
vex

frighten

but
those
not
so
near

and
still
more
those
furthest
off

thought
that
the
place
was
alreadi
taken
at
that
point

and
fled
in

to
the
sea
and
the

brasida

perceiv
that
they
were
desert
the
parapet

and
see
what
was
go
on

dash
forward
with
his
troop

and
immedi
took
the
fort

and
put
to
the
sword
all
whom
he
found
in
it

in
this
way
the
place
was
evacu
by
the
athenian

who
went
across
in
their
boat
and
ship
to
pallen

now
there
is
a
templ
of
athene
in
lecythus

and
brasida
had
proclaim
in
the
moment
of
make
the
assault
that
he
would
give
thirti
silver
mina
to
the
man
first
on
the
wall

be
now
of
opinion
that
the
captur
was
scarc
due
to
human
mean

he
gave
the
thirti
mina
to
the
goddess
for
her
templ

and
raze
and
clear
lecythus

and
made
the
whole
of
it
consecr
ground

the
rest
of
the
winter
he
spent
in
settl
the
place
in
his
hand

and
in
make
design
upon
the
rest

and
with
the
expir
of
the
winter
the
eighth
year
of
this
war
end


in
the
spring
of
the
summer
follow

the
lacedaemonian
and
athenian
made
an
armistic
for
a
year

the
athenian
think
that
they
would
thus
have
full
leisur
to
take
their
precaut
befor
brasida
could
procur
the
revolt
of
ani
more
of
their
town

and
might
also

if
it
suit
them

conclud
a
general
peac

the
lacedaemonian
divin
the
actual
fear
of
the
athenian

and
think
that
after
onc
tast
a
respit
from
troubl
and
miseri
they
would
be
more
dispos
to
consent
to
a
reconcili

and
to
give
back
the
prison

and
make
a
treati
for
the
longer
period

the
great
idea
of
the
lacedaemonian
was
to
get
back
their
men
while
brasida
s
good
fortun
last

further
success
might
make
the
struggl
a
less
unequ
one
in
chalcidic

but
would
leav
them
still
depriv
of
their
men

and
even
in
chalcidic
not
more
than
a
match
for
the
athenian
and
by
no

certain
of
victori

an

the

say
that

that
their

on

were
carri

the

had
no

brasida
cross
over
by
night
to
scion

with
a
friend
galley
ahead
and
himself
in

some

his
idea
be
that
if

larger

he
would
have
the
galley
to
defend
him

while

would
probabl
neglect
the

and
thus
leav
him
time

his

effect

he
call

spoke
to
the

effect
as
at

ad
that
they
merit
the

commend

in

in

instead
of

wait
until

this
was
a
sign
that
they

trial

howev
great

and
if

he
should
count

of

to
sustain
the
attack
of
a
numer

barbarian
enemi

i
should
just
have
said
a
few
word
to
you
as
usual
without
further
explan

as
it
is

in
the
face
of
the
desert
of
our

and
the
number
of
the

i
have
some
advic
and
inform
to
offer

which

brief
as
they
must
be

will

i
hope

suffic
for
the
more
import
point

the
braveri
that
you
habitu
display
in

doe
not

on

on

nor

in
which

rather
the

the
mani

owe
their
posit
to
noth
els
than
to
superior
in
the
field

inexperi
now
make
you
afraid
of
barbarian

and
yet
the
trial
of
strength
which
you
had
with
the
macedonian
among
them

and
my
own
judgment

confirm
by
what
i
hear
from
other

should
be
enough
to
satisfi
you
that
they
will
not
prove
formid

where
an
enemi
seem
strong
but
is
realli
weak

a
true
knowledg
of
the
fact
make
his
adversari
the
bolder

just
as
a
serious
antagonist
is
encount
most
confid
by
those
who
do
not
know
him

thus
the
present
enemi
might
terrifi
an
inexperienc
imagin

they
are
formid
in
outward
bulk

their
loud
yell
is
unbear

and
the
brandish
of
their
weapon
in
the
air
has
a
threaten
appear

but
when
it
come
to
real
fight
with
an
oppon
who
stand
his
ground

they
are
not
what
they
seem

they
have
no
regular
order
that
they
should
be
asham
of
desert
their
posit
when
hard
press

flight
and
attack
are
with
them
equal
honour

and
afford
no
test
of
courag

their
independ
mode
of
fight
never
leav
ani
one
who
want
to
run
away
without
a
fair
excus

so
do

in
short

they
think
frighten
you
at
a
secur
distanc
a
surer
game
than
meet
you
hand
to
hand

otherwis
they
would
have
done
the
one
and
not
the
other

you
can
thus
plain
see
that
the
terror
with
which
they
were
at
first
invest
are
in
fact
trifl
enough

though
to
the
eye
and
ear
veri
promin

stand
your
ground
therefor
when
they
advanc

and
again
wait
your
opportun
to
retir
in
good
order

and
you
will
reach
a
place
of
safeti
all
the
sooner

and
will
know
for
ever
afterward
that
rabbl
such
as
these

to
those
who
sustain
their
first
attack

do
but
show
off
their
courag
by
threat
of
the
terribl
thing
that
they
are
go
to
do

at
a
distanc

but
with
those
who
give
way
to
them
are
quick
enough
to
display
their
heroism
in
pursuit
when
they
can
do
so
without
danger



with
this
brief
address

across

and
thus
made
it
imposs

fulli
expect

with
the

after
remain
quiet
for
some

cleon
was
at
length
oblig
to
do
as
brasida
expect

his
soldier

tire
of
their

began
also
serious
to
reflect
on
the
weak
and
incompet
of
their
command

and
the
skill
and
valour
that
would
be
oppos
to
him

and
on
their
own

unwilling
to
accompani
him

these
murmur
come
to
the
ear
of
cleon

he
resolv
not
to
disgust
the
armi
by
keep
it
in
the

place

and
broke
up
his
camp
and
advanc

the
temper
of
the
general
was
what
it
had
been
at
pylo

his
success
on
that
occas
have
given
him
confid
in
his
capac

he
never
dream
of
ani
one
come
out
to
fight
him

but
said
that
he
was
rather
go
up
to
view
the
place

and
if
he
wait
for
his
reinforc

it
was
not
in
order
to
make
victori
secur
in
case
he
should
be
compel
to
engag

but
to
be
enabl
to
surround
and
storm
the
citi

he
accord
came
and
post
his
armi
upon
a
strong
hill
in
front
of
amphipoli

and
proceed
to
examin
the
lake
form
by
the
strymon

and
how
the
town
lay
on
the
side
of
thrace

he
thought
to
retir
at
pleasur
without
fight

as
there
was
no
one
to
be
seen
upon
the
wall
or
come
out
of
the
gate

all
of
which
were
shut

indeed

it
seem
a
mistak
not
to
have
brought
down
engin
with
him

he
could
then
have
taken
the
town

there
be
no
one
to
defend
it


as
soon
as
brasida
saw
the
athenian
in
motion
he
descend
himself
from
cerdylium
and
enter
amphipoli

he
did
not
ventur
to
go
out
in
regular
order
against
the
athenian

he
mistrust
his
strength

and
thought
it
inadequ
to
the
attempt

not
in
number

these
were
not
so
unequ

but
in
qualiti

the
flower
of
the
athenian
armi
be
in
the
field

with
the
best
of
the
lemnian
and
imbrian

he
therefor
prepar
to
assail
them
by
stratagem

by
show
the
enemi
the
number
of
his
troop

and
the
shift
which
he
had
been
put
to
to
to
arm
them

he
thought
that
he
should
have
less
chanc
of
beat
him
than
by
not
let
him
have
a
sight
of
them

and
thus
learn
how
good
a
right
he
had
to
despis
them

he
accord
pick
out
a
hundr
and
fifti
heavi
infantri
and

put
the
rest
under
clearida

determin
to
attack
sudden
befor
the
athenian
retir

think
that
he
should
not
have
again
such
a
chanc
of
catch
them
alon

if
their
reinforc
were
onc
allow
to
come
up

and
so
call
all
his
soldier
togeth
in
order
to
encourag
them
and
explain
his
intent

spoke
as
follow



peloponnesian

the
charact
of
the
countri
from
which
we
have
come

one
which
has
alway
owe
it
freedom
to
valour

and
the
fact
that
you
are
dorian
and
the
enemi
you
are
about
to
fight
ionian

whom
you
are
accustom
to
beat

are
thing
that
do
not
need
further
comment

but
the
plan
of
attack
that
i
propos
to
pursu

this
it
is
as
well
to
explain

in
order
that
the
fact
of
our
adventur
with
a
part
instead
of
with
the
whole
of
our
forc
may
not
damp
your
courag
by
the
appar
disadvantag
at
which
it
place
you

i
imagin
it
is
the
poor
opinion
that
he
has
of
us

and
the
fact
that
he
has
no
idea
of
ani
one
come
out
to
engag
him

that
has
made
the
enemi
march
up
to
the
place
and
careless
look
about
him
as
he
is
do

without
notic
us

but
the
most
success
soldier
will
alway
be
the
man
who
most
happili
detect
a
blunder
like
this

and
who
care
consult
his
own
mean
make
his
attack
not
so
much
by
open
and
regular
approach

as
by
seiz
the
opportun
of
the
moment

and
these
stratagem

which
do
the
greatest
servic
to
our
friend
by
most
complet
deceiv
our
enemi

have
the
most
brilliant
name
in
war

therefor

while
their
careless
confid
continu

and
they
are
still
think

as
in
my
judgment
they
are
now
do

more
of
retreat
than
of
maintain
their
posit

while
their
spirit
is
slack
and
not
high
strung
with
expect

i
with
the
men
under
my
command
will

if
possibl

take
them
by
surpris
and
fall
with
a
run
upon
their
centr

and
do
you

clearida

afterward

when
you
see
me
alreadi
upon
them

and

as
is
like

deal
terror
among
them

take
with
you
the
amphipolitan

and
the
rest
of
the
alli

and
sudden
open
the
gate
and
dash
at
them

and
hasten
to
engag
as
quick
as
you
can

that
is
our
best
chanc
of
establish
a
panic
among
them

as
a
fresh
assail
has
alway
more
terror
for
an
enemi
than
the
one
he
is
immedi
engag
with

show
yourself
a
brave
man

as
a
spartan
should

and
do
you

alli

follow
him
like
men

and
rememb
that
zeal

honour

and
obedi
mark
the
good
soldier

and
that
this
day
will
make
you
either
free
men
and
alli
of
lacedaemon

or
slave
of
athen

even
if
you
escap
without
person
loss
of
liberti
or
life

your
bondag
will
be
on
harsher
term
than
befor

and
you
will
also
hinder
the
liber
of
the
rest
of
the
hellen

no
cowardic
then
on
your
part

see
the
great
of
the
issu
at
stake

and
i
will
show
that
what
i
preach
to
other
i
can
practis
myself



after
this
brief
speech
brasida
himself
prepar
for
the
salli

and
place
the
rest
with
clearida
at
the
thracian
gate
to
support
him
as
had
been
agre

meanwhil
he
had
been
seen
come
down
from
cerdylium
and
then
in
the
citi

which
is
overlook
from
the
outsid

sacrif
near
the
templ
of
athene

in
short

all
his
movement
had
been
observ

and
word
was
brought
to
cleon

who
had
at
the
moment
gone
on
to
look
about
him

that
the
whole
of
the
enemi
s
forc
could
be
seen
in
the
town

and
that
the
feet
of
hors
and
men
in
great
number
were
visibl
under
the
gate

as
if
a
salli
were
intend

upon
hear
this
he
went
up
to
look

and
have
done
so

be
unwil
to
ventur
upon
the
decis
step
of
a
battl
befor
his
reinforc
came
up

and
fanci
that
he
would
have
time
to
retir

bid
the
retreat
be
sound
and
sent
order
to
the
men
to
effect
it
by
move
on
the
left
wing
in
the
direct
of
eion

which
was
inde
the
onli
way
practic

this
howev
not
be
quick
enough
for
him

he
join
the
retreat
in
person
and
made
the
right
wing
wheel
round

thus
turn
it
unarm
side
to
the
enemi

it
was
then
that
brasida

see
the
athenian
forc
in
motion
and
his
opportun
come

said
to
the
men
with
him
and
the
rest


those
fellow
will
never
stand
befor
us

one
can
see
that
by
the
way
their
spear
and
head
are
go

troop
which
do
as
they
do
seldom
stand
a
charg

quick

someon

and
open
the
gate
i
spoke
of

and
let
us
be
out
and
at
them
with
no
fear
for
the
result


accord
issu

by
the
palisad
gate
and
by
the
first
in
the
long
wall
then
exist

he
ran
at
the
top
of
his
speed
along
the
straight
road

where
the
trophi
now
stand
as
you
go
by
the
steepest
part
of
the
hill

and
fell
upon
and
rout
the
centr
of
the
athenian

panic
stricken
by
their
own
disord
and
astound
at
his
audac

at
the

moment
clearida
in
execut
of
his
order
issu
out
from
the
thracian
gate
to
support
him

and
also
attack
the
enemi

the
result
was
that
the
athenian

sudden
and
unexpect
attack
on
both
side

fell
into
confus

and
their
left
toward
eion

which
had
alreadi
got
on
some
distanc

at
onc
broke
and
fled

just
as
it
was
in

and
brasida
was

on
to
attack
the
right

he
receiv
a
wound

but
his
fall
was
not
perceiv
by
the
athenian

as
he
was
taken
up
by
those
near
him
and
carri
off
the
field

the
athenian
right
made
a
better
stand

and
though
cleon

who
from
the
first
had
no
thought
of
fight

at
onc
fled
and
was
overtaken
and
slain
by
a
myrcinian
target

his
infantri
form
in
close
order
upon
the
hill
twice
or
thrice
repuls
the
attack
of
clearida

and
did
not
final
give
way
until
they
were
surround
and
rout
by
the
missil
of
the
myrcinian
and
chalcidian
hors
and
the

thus
the
athenian

was
all
now
in

and
obliter
everyth

they
could
no

they
also
gave
the

ramphia
and
his

penetr

they
turn

gone

and
themselv
not
equal
to
the

of

the
main
caus

was
becaus
they
knew
that

was
realli
in

of

indeed
it
so

the

the

of

lacedaemon

on

found
the

of

to
falsifi
her

that
a

would
suffic
for
the
overthrow
of
the
power
of

by

she

so
that
it

and
honour
which
war
gave
him

the

becaus
he
thought
that

if

his

would
be
more
open
to

his

thought
the
way
to

this
was
to

commit

regular
held
up

them
to
the

of

upon

that
befel
them

as
though
his
unjust
restor
were
the
caus

the
accus
be
that
he

had

the
prophetess
of

els
they
would
have

in

it
was

in

they
had

the
smart
of

and
the
reflect
that
in

no

and
that
when

would
be

but
when

the

relax

to

went

the
athenian
answer
be
that

nevertheless
the

in

began

go

they
fanci
that

to

therefor

no

a

in

in

strait
the
argive

afraid
that

as
the
result
of
refus
to
renew
the
treati
with

and
of
aspir
to
the
supremaci
in

they
would
have
the

tegean

boeotian

and
athenian
on

all
at

now
hastili
sent
off

who
seem
the

most
like
to

accept

as

with
the
view
of
make
as
good
a
treati
as
they
could
with

upon
such
term
as
could
be
got

have
reach
lacedaemon

their

proceed
to
negoti
the
term
of
the

treati

what
the
argive
first
demand
was
that
they
might
be
allow
to
refer
to
the

of
some
state
or
privat
person
the
question
of
the
cynurian
land

a
piec
of

territori
about
which
they
have
alway
been
disput

and
which
contain
the
town
of
thyrea
and
anthene

and
is
occupi
by
the
lacedaemonian

the
lacedaemonian
at
first
said
that
they
could
not
allow
this
point
to
be
discuss

but
were
readi
to
conclud
upon
the
old
term

eventual

howev

the

ambassador
succeed
in
obtain
from
them
this
concess

for
the
present
there
was
to
be
a

for
fifti
year

but
it
should
be
compet
for
either
parti

there
be
neither
plagu
nor
war
in
lacedaemon
or
argos

to
give
a
formal
challeng
and
decid
the

territori
by

former
occas

when
both
side
claim
the
victori

pursuit
not
be

beyond
the
frontier
of
argos
or
lacedaemon

the
lacedaemonian
at
first
thought
this
mere
folli

but
at
last

anxious
at
ani
cost
to
have
the
friendship
of
argos
they
agre
to
the
term
demand

and
reduc
them
to

howev

befor

antimenida

who
were
to
receiv
the
prison
from
the
boeotian
and
restor
them
and
panactum
to
the
athenian

found
that
the
boeotian
had
themselv
raze
panactum

upon
the
plea
that
oath
had
been
ancient
exchang
between
their
peopl
and
the
athenian

after
a
disput
on
the
subject
to
the
effect
that
neither
should
inhabit

place

but
that
they
should
graze
it
in

as
for
the
athenian
prison
of

in

of
the
boeotian

these
were
deliv
over
to
andromed
and
his
colleagu

and
by
them
convey
to
athen

given
back

the

at

this
announc
was
receiv
with
great
indign

the
athenian

who
thought
that

which
ought

the
athenian
also
consid

other
point
in
which
lacedaemon
had
fail
in
her
compact

and
think
that
they
had
been
overreach

gave
an
angri
answer
to
the
ambassador
and
sent
them
away


the
breach
between
the
lacedaemonian
and
athenian
have
gone
thus

the
parti
at
athen

also

who
wish
to
cancel

foremost
amongst

for

negoti
the
treati
through
nicia
and
lach

and
have
overlook
him
on

of

and
also
for
not

shown
him
the
respect
due
to
the
ancient
connect
of
his
famili
with

as
their
proxeni

which

renounc
by
his

he
had
late
himself
thought
to
renew
by
his
attent
to
their
prison
taken
in
the
island

be
thus

as
he
thought

slight
on
all
hand

he
had
in
the
first
instanc
spoken
against
the
treati

say
that
the
lacedaemonian
were
not
to
be
trust

but
that
they
onli
treat

in
order
to
be
enabl
by
this
mean
to
crush
argos

and
afterward
to
attack
athen
alon

and
now

immedi
upon
the
abov
occur

he
sent
privat

tell
them
to

as
possibl
to

accompani
by
the
mantinean

with

was
propiti

he
himself
would
do
all
he
could
to
help
them


upon
receiv
this
messag
and
discov
that
the
athenian

far
from
be
privi
to
the
boeotian
allianc

were
involv
in
a
serious
quarrel
with
the
lacedaemonian

the
argive
paid
no
further
attent
to
the
embassi
which
they
had
just
sent
to
lacedaemon
on
the
subject
of
the
treati

and
began
to
inclin
rather
toward
the
athenian

reflect
that

in
the
event
of
war

they
would
thus
have
on
their
side
a
citi
that
was
not
onli
an
ancient
alli
of

but
a

democraci
and

they
accord
at

sent

at

upon

that

the

toward

at

which
were
held
this
summer

and
in

the

was
victor
the

in

the

say

the

affirm

they

and
that

while

quiet

of

and
not

upon

the

submit

that
if

realli
believ
that
they
had
commit
an

it
was
useless
after
that
to

but
they
had
proclaim
it
notwithstand

as
believ
noth
of
the
kind

and
from
that
moment
the
lacedaemonian
had
made
no
attack
upon

nevertheless
the
elean
adher
to
what
they
had
said

that
noth
would
persuad
them
that

if

howev

the

they
would
give
up

as
this

was
not
accept

the

tri
a

instead
of
restor
lepreum

if
this
was
object
to

the
lacedaemonian
should
ascend
the
altar
of
the

zeus

as
they
were
so
anxious
to
have
access
to
the

and
swear
befor
the

that
they
would
sure
pay
the

great

were
felt
in

the

they

the

the

one
of

and
one
and

make
each
man
do
his

to
shelter
his

with
the

of

primarili

who
is
alway
strive

and
the

make

follow
him

on

occas
the

reach
with
their

far
beyond
the
scirita

and
the
lacedaemonian
and
tegean
still
farther
beyond
the
athenian

as
their

was
the
largest

agis

afraid
of
his

be
surround

and
think
that
the

outflank
it
too

order
the

to
move
out
from

in

make
the

even
with

told
the

to
fill
up
the

thus
form

by
throw
themselv
into

with
two
compani
taken
from

think
that
his

would
still
be
strong
enough

to
spare

and
that
the
line
front
the

would
gain
in
solid


howev

as
he
gave
these
order
in
the
moment
of

and
at
short
notic

it
so
happen
that
aristocl

hipponoida
would
not
move
over

for
which
offenc
they
were
afterward
banish
from

as
have
been
guilti
of
cowardic

and
the

meanwhil
close
befor
the

agis
on

that
the

did
not
move
over
order
to
return
to
their

had
time
to
fill
up
the
breach
in

now
it
was

howev

that
the
lacedaemonian

utter
worst
in
respect
of
skill

show
themselv
as
superior
in
point
of
courag

as
soon
as
they
came
to
close
quarter
with
the
enemi

the
mantinean
right
broke
their
scirita

brasidean

and

burst
in
with
their
alli
and
the
thousand
pick
argive
into
the
unclos
breach
in
their

cut
up
and
surround
the
lacedaemonian

and
drove
them
in
full
rout
to
the
wagon

slay
some
of
the

on

there

but
the
lacedaemonian

worst
in
this
part
of

with
the

where
the

the

not

indeed
they

for

and
deceiv
the

of

by
seduct

which
would

without

we

that
this

we

you

that
all
we
can
reason
expect
from

is
war

slaveri

it
is
natur

excus

in

to

both
in

the
question
in

is

as
you
say

the
safeti
of

and
the
discuss

if
you
pleas

can
proceed
in
the
way
which
you
propos


athenian

for

we
shall
not
troubl
you
with
specious
pretenc

either
of
how
we
have
a
right
to

becaus
we
overthrew
the

or
are
now
attack
you
becaus
of
wrong
that
you
have
done
us

and
make
a
long
speech
which
would
not
be

and
in
return
we
hope
that
you

instead
of
think
to
influenc
us
by
say
that
you
did
not
join
the
lacedaemonian

although
their
colonist

or
that
you
have
done
us
no
wrong

will
aim
at
what
is
feasibl

hold
in

the
real
sentiment
of
us
both

sinc
you
know
as
well
as
we
do
that
right

as
the
world
goe

is
onli
in
question
between
equal
in
power

while
the
strong
do
what
they
can
and
the
weak
suffer
what
they
must


melian

as
we
think

at
ani
rate

it
is
expedi

we
speak
as
we
are
oblig

sinc
you
enjoin
us
to
let
right
alon
and
talk
onli
of
interest

that
you
should
not
destroy
what
is
our
common
protect

the
privileg
of
be
allow
in
danger
to
invok
what
is
fair
and
right

and
even
to
profit
by
argument
not
strict
valid
if
they
can
be
got
to
pass
current

and
you
are
as
much
interest
in
this
as
ani

as
your
fall
would
be
a
signal
for
the
heaviest
vengeanc
and
an
exampl
for
the
world
to
medit
upon


athenian

the
end
of
our
empir

if
end
it
should

doe
not
frighten
us

a
rival
empir
like
lacedaemon

even
if
lacedaemon
was
our
real
antagonist

is
not
so
terribl
to
the
vanquish
as
subject
who
by
themselv
attack
and
overpow
their
ruler

this

howev

is
a
risk
that
we
are
content
to
take

we
will
now
proceed
to
show
you
that
we
are
come
here
in
the
interest
of
our
empir

and
that
we
shall
say
what
we
are
now
go
to
say

for
the
preserv
of
your
countri

as
we
would
fain
exercis
that
empir
over
you
without
troubl

and
see
you
preserv
for
the
good
of
us
both


melian

and
how

pray

could
it
turn
out
as
good
for
us
to
serv
as
for
you
to
rule


athenian

becaus
you
would
have
the
advantag
of
submit
befor
suffer
the
worst

and
we
should
gain
by
not
destroy
you


melian

so
that
you
would
not
consent
to
our
be
neutral

friend
instead
of
enemi

but
alli
of
neither
side


athenian

no

for
your
hostil
cannot
so
much
hurt
us
as
your
friendship
will
be
an
argument
to
our
subject
of
our
weak

and
your
enmiti
of
our
power


melian

is
that
your
subject

idea
of
equiti

to
put
those
who
have
noth
to
do
with
you
in
the
same
categori
with
peopl
that
are
most
of
them
your
own
colonist

and
some
conquer
rebel


athenian

as
far
as
right
goe
they
think
one
has
as
much
of
it
as
the
other

and
that
if
ani
maintain
their
independ
it
is
becaus
they
are
strong

and
that
if
we
do
not
molest
them
it
is
becaus
we
are
afraid

so
that
besid
extend
our
empir
we
should
gain
in
secur
by
your
subject

the
fact
that
you
are
island
and
weaker
than
other
render
it
all
the
more
import
that
you
should
not
succeed
in
baffl
the
master
of
the
sea


melian

but
do
you
consid
that
there
is
no
secur
in
the
polici
which
we
indic

for
here
again
if
you
debar
us
from
talk
about
justic
and
invit
us
to
obey
your
interest

we
also
must
explain
our

and
tri
to
persuad
you

if
the
two
happen
to
coincid

how
can
you
avoid
make
enemi
of
all
exist
neutral
who
shall
look
at
case
from
it
that
one
day
or
anoth
you
will
attack
them

and
what
is
this
but
to
make
greater
the
enemi
that
you
have
alreadi

and
to
forc
other
to
becom
so
who
would
otherwis
have
never
thought
of
it


athenian

whi

the
fact
is
that
continent
general
give
us
but
littl
alarm

the
liberti
which
they
enjoy
will
long
prevent
their
take
precaut
against
us

it
is
rather
island
like
yourselv

outsid
our
empir

and
subject
smart
under
the
yoke

who
would
be
the
most
like
to
take
a
rash
step
and
lead
themselv
and
us
into
obvious
danger


melian

well
then

if
you
risk
so
much
to
retain
your
empir

and
your
subject
to
get
rid
of
it

it
were
sure
great
base
and
cowardic
in
us
who
are
still
free
not
to
tri
everyth
that
can
be
tri

befor
submit
to
your
yoke


athenian

not
if
you
are
well
advis

the
contest
not
be
an
equal
one

with
honour
as
the
prize
and
shame
as
the
penalti

but
a
question
of
self
preserv
and
of
not
resist
those
who
are
far
stronger
than
you
are


melian

but
we
know
that
the
fortun
of
war
is
sometim
more
imparti
than
the
disproport
of
number
might
lead
one
to
suppos

to
submit
is
to
give
ourselv
over
to
despair

while

still
preserv
for
us
a

that
we
may

may
be

by
those
who
have
abund

if
not
without

at

without

but
it
natur
is
to
be
extravag

and
those
who
go
so
far
as
to
put

upon

see
it
in

true

onli
when

but
so
long
as

would
enabl

to

it

let
not
this
be
the
case
with
you

who
are
weak
and
hang
on
a
singl
turn
of

nor
be

you
may
be

that
we
are
as
well
awar
as
you
of
the
difficulti
of
contend
against
your
power
and
fortun

unless
the
term
be
equal

but
we
trust
that
the
god
may
grant
us
fortun
as
good
as
your

sinc
we
are
just
men
fight
against
unjust

and
that
what
we
want
in
power
will
be
made
up
by
the
allianc
of
the
lacedaemonian

who
are
bound

if
onli
for
veri
shame

to
come
to
the
aid
of
their
kindr

our
confid

therefor

after
all
is
not
so
utter
irrat


athenian

when
you
speak
of
the
favour
of
the
god

we
may
as
fair
hope
for
that
as
yourselv

neither
our
pretens
nor
our
conduct
be
in
ani
way
contrari
to
what
men
believ
of
the
god

or
practis
among
themselv

of
the
god
we
believ

and
of
men
we
know

that
by
a
necessari
law
of
their
natur
they
rule
wherev
they
can

and
it
is
not
as
if
we
were
the
first
to
make
this
law

or
to
act
upon
it
when
made

we
found
it
exist
befor
us

and
shall
leav
it
to
exist
for
ever
after
us

all
we
do
is
to
make
use
of
it

know
that
you
and
everybodi
els

have
the
same
power
as
we
have

would
do
the
same
as
we
do

thus

as
far
as
the
god
are
concern

we
have
no
fear
and
no
reason
to
fear
that
we
shall
be
at
a
disadvantag

but
when
we
come
to
your
notion
about
the
lacedaemonian

which
lead
you
to
believ
that
shame
will
make
them
help
you

here
we
bless
your
simplic
but
do
not
envi
your
folli

the
lacedaemonian

when
their
own
interest
or
their
countri
s
law
are
in
question

are
the
worthiest
men
aliv

of
their
conduct
toward
other
much
might
be
said

but
no
clearer
idea
of
it
could
be
given
than
by
short
say
that
of
all
the
men
we
know
they
are
most
conspicu
in
consid
what
is
agreeabl
honour

and
what
is
expedi
just

such
a
way
of
think
doe
not
promis
much
for
the
safeti
which
you
now
unreason
count
upon


melian

but
it
is
for
this
veri
reason
that
we
now
trust
to
their
respect
for
expedi
to
prevent
them
from
betray
the
melian

their
colonist

and
therebi
lose
the
confid
of
their
friend
in
hella
and
help
their
enemi


athenian

then
you
do
not
adopt
the
view
that
expedi
goe
with
secur

while
justic
and
honour
cannot
be
follow
without
danger

and
danger
the
lacedaemonian
general
court
as
littl
as
possibl


melian

but
we
believ
that
they
would
be
more
like
to
face
even
danger
for
our
sake

and
with
more
confid
than
for
other

as
our
near
to
peloponnes
make
it
easier
for
them
to
act

and
our
common
blood
ensur
our
fidel


athenian

yes

but
what
an
intend
alli
trust
to
is
not
the
goodwil
of
those
who
ask
his
aid

but
a
decid
superior
of
power
for
action

and
the
lacedaemonian
look
to
this
even
more
than
other

at
least

such
is
their
distrust
of
their
home
resourc
that
it
is
onli
with
numer
alli
that
they
attack
a
neighbour

now
is
it
like
that
while
we
are
master
of
the
sea
they
will
cross
over
to
an
island


melian

but
they
would
have
other
to
send

the
cretan
sea
is
a
wide
one

and
it
is
more
difficult
for
those
who
command
it
to
intercept
other

than
for
those
who
wish
to
elud
them
to
do
so
safe

and
should
the
lacedaemonian
miscarri
in
this

they
would
fall
upon
your
land

and
upon
those
left
of
your
alli
whom
brasida
did
not
reach

and
instead
of
place
which
are
not
your

you
will
have
to
fight
for
your
own
countri
and
your
own
confederaci


athenian

some
divers
of
the
kind
you
speak
of
you
may
one
day
experi

onli
to
learn

as
other
have
done

that
the
athenian
never
onc
yet
withdrew
from
a
sieg
for
fear
of
ani

but
we
are
struck
by
the
fact
that

after
say
you
would
consult
for
the
safeti
of
your
countri

in
all
this
discuss
you
have
mention
noth
which
men
might
trust
in
and
think
to
be
save
by

your
strongest
argument
depend
upon
hope
and
the
futur

and
your
actual
resourc
are
too
scanti

as
compar
with
those
array
against
you

for
you
to
come
out
victori

you
will
therefor
show
great
blind
of
judgment

unless

after
allow
us
to
retir

you
can
find
some
counsel
more
prudent
than
this

you
will
sure
not
be
caught
by
that
idea
of
disgrac

which
in
danger
that
are
disgrac

and
at
the
same
time
too
plain
to
be
mistaken

prove
so
fatal
to
mankind

sinc
in
too
mani
case
the
veri
men
that
have
their
eye
perfect
open
to
what
they
are
rush
into

let
the
thing
call
disgrac

by
the
mere
influenc
of
a
seduct
name

lead
them
on
to
a
point
at
which
they
becom
so
enslav
by
the
phrase
as
in
fact
to
fall
wil
into
hopeless
disast

and
incur
disgrac
more
disgrac
as
the
companion
of
error

than
when
it
come
as
the
result
of
misfortun

this

if
you
are
well
advis

you
will
guard
against

and
you
will
not
think
it
dishonour
to
submit
to
the
greatest
citi
in

when
it
make
you
the
moder
offer
of
becom

will
you
be
so
blind

it
is
certain
that
those
who

not
yield
to
their
equal

who
keep
term
with
their
superior

and
are
moder
toward
their
inferior

on
the
whole
succeed
best

think
over
the
matter

therefor

after
our
withdraw

and
reflect
onc
and
again
that
it
is
for
your

you

that
you

the

now
withdrew
from

the

left

came
to
a

with
what
they
had
maintain

our

is

most
of

be
ignor
of

and
of
the
fact
that
they
were

not

for
the

the

spoken
of

i
cannot
tell
of

they
were

and
must
leav
my

to
what
the

concern

to
have
been
the

settler

although
they
pretend
to
have
been
the

but
the
fact
show
that
they
were
iberian

driven
by
the

it
was
from

but
they
were
especi
incit
by
envoy
from

who
had
come

more

advis

but
upon
a
slight
aid
specious
pretext
was
aspir
to
the
conquest
of
the
whole
of
sicili

a
great
matter
to
achiev

came
forward
in
the
hope
of
divert
the
athenian
from
the
enterpris

and
gave
them
the
follow
counsel



although
this
assembl
was
conven
to
consid
the
prepar
to
be
made
for
sail
to
sicili

i
think

notwithstand

that
we
have
still
this
question
to
examin

whether
it
be
better
to
send
out
the
ship
at
all

and
that
we
ought
not
to
give
so
littl
consider
to
a
matter
of
such
moment

or
let
ourselv
be
persuad
by
foreign
into
undertak
a
war
with
which
we
have
noth
to
do

and
yet

individu

i
gain
in
honour
by
such
a
cours

and
fear
as
littl
as
other
men
for
my
person

not
that
i
think
a
man
need
be
ani
the
wors
citizen
for
take
some
thought
for
his
person
and
estat

on
the
contrari

such
a
man
would
for
his
own
sake
desir
the
prosper
of
his
countri
more
than
other

nevertheless

as
i
have
never
spoken
against
my
convict
to
gain
honour

i
shall
not
begin
to
do
so
now

but
shall
say
what
i
think
best

against
your
charact
ani
word
of
mine
would
be
weak
enough

if
i
were
to
advis
your
keep
what
you
have
got
and
not
risk
what
is
actual
your
for
advantag
which
are
dubious
in
themselv

and
which
you
may
or
may
not
attain

i
will

therefor

content
myself
with
show
that
your
ardour
is
out
of
season

and
your
ambit
not
easi
of
accomplish



i
affirm

then

that
you
leav
mani
enemi
behind
you
here
to
go
yonder
and
bring
more
back
with
you

you
imagin

perhap

that
the
treati
which
you
have
made
can
be
trust

a
treati
that
will
continu
to
exist
nomin

as
long
as
you
keep
quiet

for
nomin
it
has
becom

owe
to
the
practic
of
certain
men
here
and
at
sparta

but
which
in
the
event
of
a
serious
revers
in
ani
quarter
would
not
delay
our
enemi
a
moment
in
attack
us

first

becaus
the
convent
was
forc
upon
them
by
disast
and
was
less
honour
to
them
than
to
us

and
second

becaus
in
this
veri
convent
there
are
mani
point
that
are
still
disput

again

some
of
the
most
power
state
have
never
yet
accept
the
arrang
at
all

some
of
these
are
at
open
war
with
us

other

as
the
lacedaemonian
do
not
yet
move

are
restrain
by
truce
renew
everi
ten
day

and
it
is
onli
too
probabl
that
if
they
found
our
power
divid

as
we
are
hurri
to
divid
it

they
would
attack
us
vigor
with
the
siceliot

whose
allianc
they
would
have
in
the
past
valu
as
they
would
that
of
few
other

a
man
ought

therefor

to
consid
these
point

and
not
to
think
of
run
risk
with
a
countri
place
so
critic

or
of
grasp
at
anoth
empir
befor
we
have
secur
the
one
we
have
alreadi

for
in
fact
the
thracian
chalcidian
have
been
all
these
year
in
revolt
from
us
without
be
yet
subdu

and
other
on
the
contin
yield
us
but
a
doubt
obedi

meanwhil
the
egestaean

our
alli

have
been
wrong

and
we
run
to
help
them

while
the
rebel
who
have
so
long
wrong
us
still
wait
for
punish



and
yet
the
latter

if
brought
under

might
be
kept
under

while
the
sicilian

even
if
conquer

are
too
far
off
and
too
numer
to
be
rule
without
difficulti

now
it
is
folli
to
go
against
men
who
could
not
be
kept
under
even
if
conquer

while
failur
would
leav
us
in
a
veri
differ
posit
from
that
which
we
occupi
befor
the
enterpris

the
siceliot

again

to
take
them
as
they
are
at
present

in
the
event
of
a
syracusan
conquest

the
favourit
bugbear
of
the
egestaean


would
to
my
think
be
even
less
danger
to
us
than
befor

at
present
they
might
possibl
come
here
as
separ
state
for
love
of
lacedaemon

in
the
other
case
one
empir
would
scarc
attack
anoth

for
after
join
the
peloponnesian
to
overthrow
our

they
could
onli
expect
to
see
the
same
hand
overthrow
their
own
in
the
same
way

the
hellen
in
sicili
would
fear
us
most
if
we
never
went
there
at
all

and
next
to
this

if
after
display
our
power
we
went
away
again
as
soon
as
possibl

we
all
know
that
that
which
is
farthest
off

and
the
reput
of
which
can
least
be
test

is
the
object
of
admir

at
the
least
revers
they
would
at
onc
begin
to
look
down
upon
us

and
would
join
our
enemi
here
against
us

you
have
yourselv
experienc
this
with
regard
to
the
lacedaemonian
and
their
alli

whom
your
unexpect
success

as
compar
with
what
you
fear
at
first

has
made
you
sudden
despis

tempt
you
further
to
aspir
to
the
conquest
of
sicili

instead

howev

of
be
puf
up
by
the
misfortun
of
your
adversari

you
ought
to
think
of
break
their
spirit
befor
give
yourselv
up
to
confid

and
to
understand
that
the
one
thought
awaken
in
the
lacedaemonian
by
their
disgrac
is
how
they
may
even
now

if
possibl

overthrow
us
and
repair
their
dishonour

inasmuch
as
militari
reput
is
their
oldest
and
chiefest
studi

our
struggl

therefor

if
we
are
wise

will
not
be
for
the
barbarian
egestaean
in
sicili

but
how
to
defend
ourselv
most
effectu
against
the
oligarch
machin
of
lacedaemon



we
should
also
rememb
that
we
are
but
now
enjoy
some
respit
from
a
great
pestil
and
from
war

to
the
no
small
benefit
of
our
estat
and
person

and
that
it
is
right
to
employ
these
at
home
on
our
own
behalf

instead
of
use
them
on
behalf
of
these
exil
whose
interest
it
is
to
lie
as
fair
as
they
can

who
do
noth
but
talk
themselv
and
leav
the
danger
to
other

and
who
if
they
succeed
will
show
no
proper
gratitud

and
if
they
fail
will
drag
down
their
friend
with
them

and
if
there
be
ani
man
here

overjoy
at
be
chosen
to
command

who
urg
you
to
make
the
expedit

mere
for
end
of
his
own

special
if
he
be
still
too
young
to
command

who
seek
to
be
admir
for
his
stud
of
hors

but
on
account
of
it
heavi
expens
hope
for
some
profit
from
his
appoint

do
not
allow
such
a
one
to
maintain
his
privat
splendour
at
his
countri
s
risk

but
rememb
that
such
person
injur
the
public
fortun
while
they
squander
their
own

and
that
this
is
a
matter
of
import

and
not
for
a
young
man
to
decid
or
hastili
to
take
in
hand



when
i
see
such
person
now
sit
here
at
the
side
of
that
same
individu
and
summon
by
him

alarm
seiz
me

and
i

in
my
turn

summon
ani
of
the
older
men
that
may
have
such
a
person
sit
next
him
not
to
let
himself
be
shame
down

for
fear
of
be
thought
a
coward
if
he
do
not
vote
for
war

but

rememb
how
rare
success
is
got
by
wish
and
how
often
by
forecast

to
leav
to
them
the
mad
dream
of
conquest

and
as
a
true
lover
of
his
countri

now
threaten
by
the
greatest
danger
in
it
histori

to
hold
up
his
hand
on
the
other
side

to
vote
that
the
siceliot
be
left
in
the
limit
now
exist
between
us

limit
of
which
no
one
can
complain

the
ionian
sea
for
the
coast
voyag

and
the
sicilian
across
the
open
main


to
enjoy
their
own
possess
and
to
settl
their
own
quarrel

that
the
egestaean

for
their
part

be
told
to
end
by
themselv
with
the
selinuntin
the
war
which
they
began
without
consult
the
athenian

and
that
for
the
futur
we
do
not
enter
into
allianc

as
we
have
been
use
to
do

with
peopl
whom
we
must
help
in
their
need

and
who
can
never
help
us
in

and
you

prytani

if
you
think
it
your
duti
to
care
for
the
commonwealth

and
if
you
wish
to
show
yourself
a
good
citizen

put
the
question
to
the
vote

and
take
a
second
time
the
opinion
of
the
athenian

if
you
are
afraid
to
move
the
question
again

consid
that
a
violat
of
the
law
cannot
carri
ani
prejudic
with
so
mani
abettor

that
you
will
be
the
physician
of

that
the

in

this

to
do
their
countri
as
much
good
as
they
can

or
in
ani
case
no
harm
that
they
can

such
were
the
word
of
nicia

most
of
the
athenian
that
came
forward
spoke
in
favour
of
the
expedit

and
of
not
annul
what
had
been
vote

although
some
spoke
on
the
other
side

by
far
the
warmest
advoc
of
the
expedit
was

howev

alcibiad

son
of
clinia

who
wish
to
thwart
nicia
both
as
his
polit
oppon
and
also
becaus
of
the
attack
he
had
made
upon
him
in
his
speech

and
who
was

besid

exceed
ambiti
of
a
command
by
which
he
hope
to
reduc
sicili
and
carthag

and
person
to
gain
in
wealth
and
reput
by
mean
of
his
success

for
the
posit
he
held
among

led
him
to
indulg
his
tast
beyond
what
his
real
mean
would
bear

both
in
keep
hors
and
in
the
rest
of
his
expenditur

and
this
later
on
had
not
a
littl
to
do
with
the
ruin
of
the
athenian
state

alarm
at
the
great
of
his

and
of
the

down

advic
to

athenian

i
have
a
better
right
to

than

i
must
begin
with
this
as
nicia
has
attack
me

and
at
the

time
i
believ
myself
to
be
worthi
of
it

the
thing
for
which
i
am
abus

bring
fame
to

and
to
myself

and
to
the
countri
profit
besid

the
hellen

after
expect
to
see
our
citi
ruin
by
the

conclud
it
to
be
even
greater
than
it
realli
is

by
reason
of
the
magnific
with
which
i
repres
it
at
the
olympic
game

when
i
sent
into
the
list
seven
chariot

a
number
never
befor
enter
by
ani
privat
person

and
won
the
first
prize

and
was
second
and
fourth

and
took
care
to
have
everyth
els
in
a
style
worthi
of
my
victori

custom
regard
such
display
as
honour

and
they
cannot
be
made
without
leav
behind
them
an
impress
of
power

again

ani
splendour
that
i
may
have
exhibit
at
home
in
provid
chorus
or
otherwis

is
natur
envi
by
my
fellow
citizen

but
in
the
eye
of
foreign
has
an
air
of
strength
as
in
the
other
instanc

and
this
is
no
useless
folli

when
a
man
at
his
own
privat
cost
benefit
not
himself
onli

but
his
citi

nor
is
it
unfair
that
he
who
pride
himself
on
his
posit
should
refus
to
be
upon
an
equal
with
the
rest

he
who
is
bad

has
his
misfortun

to

and
as
we

a

and
then
demand
to
have

what
i

is
that

of

all

as

such
are
my

howev
i
am

the
question
is
whether

better
than
i
do

have
unit
the
most

state
of
peloponnes

without

i
compel
the
lacedaemonian
to
stake
their
all
upon
the
issu
of
a
singl
day
at
mantinea

and
although
victori
in
the
battl

they
have
never

fulli
recov

thus
did
my
youth
and
so
call
monstrous
folli
find
fit
argument
to
deal
with
the
power
of
the
peloponnesian

and
by
it
ardour
win
their
confid
and
prevail

and
do
not
be
afraid
of
my
youth
now

but
while
i
am
still
in
it
flower

and
nicia
appear
fortun

avail
yourselv
to
the
utmost
of
the
servic
of
us
both

neither
rescind
your
resolut
to
sail
to
sicili

on
the
ground
that
you
would
be
go
to
attack
a

the

are

everi

think

either
by

he
can

and
then
in

event
of

settl

and
make
his
prepar

from
a
mob
like
this
you
need
not
look
for
either
unanim

counsel
or
concert
in

but
they
will
probabl
one
by
one
come
in
as
they
get
a
fair
offer

especi
if
they
are
torn
by
civil
strife
as
we
are
told

moreov

the
siceliot
have
not
so
mani
heavi
infantri
as
they
boast

just
as
the
hellen
general
did
not
prove
so
numer
as
each
state
reckon
itself

but
hella
great
over
estim
their
number

and
has
hard
had
an
adequ
forc
of
heavi
infantri
throughout
this
war

the
state
in
sicili

therefor

from
all
that
i
can
hear

will
be
found
as
i
say

and
i
have
not
point
out
all
our
advantag

for
we
shall
have
the
help
of
mani
barbarian

who
from
their
hatr
of
the
syracusan
will
join
us
in
attack
them

nor
will
the
power
at
home
prove
ani
hindranc

if
you
judg
right

our
father
with
these
veri
adversari

which
it
is
said
we
shall
now
leav
behind
us
when
we
sail

and
the
mede
as
their
enemi
as
well

were
abl
to
win
the
empir

depend
sole
on
their
superior
at
sea

the
peloponnesian
had
never
so
littl
hope
against
us
as
at
present

and
let
them
be
ever
so
sanguin

although
strong
enough
to
invad
our
countri
even
if
we
stay
at
home

they
can
never
hurt
us
with
their
navi

as
we
leav
one
of
our
own
behind
us
that
is
a
match
for
them



in
this
state
of
thing
what
reason
can
we
give
to
ourselv
for
hold
back

or
what
excus
can
we
offer
to
our
alli
in
sicili
for
not
help
them

they
are
our
confeder

and
we
are
bound
to
assist
them

without
object
that
they
have
not
assist
us

we
did
not
take
them
into
allianc
to
have
them
to
help
us
in
hella

but
that
they
might
so
annoy
our
enemi
in

as
to

it

by

by

if

we

men

not
rest
content
with
parri

often
strike
the
first
blow
to
prevent
the

made

and
we
cannot
fix
the
exact

at

our

we
have
reach
a
posit

which
we
must
not

must
scheme
to

unless

then

that
we
shall
augment
our

and
let

see
how
littl
we

and
at

we

of

ruin

the

of

will
be

in

old
fashion
by
which
our

old
and
young
togeth

by
their
unit
counsel
brought
our
affair
to
their

height

do
you
endeavour

understand
that
neither

can
do
anyth
the

without
the

but
that
leviti

sobrieti

and
deliber
judgment
are
strongest
when
unit

and
that

by
sink
into

the
citi

like
everyth

wear

out

and
it
skill
in

while

will
give
it
fresh
experi

and
make
it
more
use
to
defend
itself
not
in

but
in

in

my
convict
is
that
a
citi
not
inact
by
natur
could
not
choos
a
quicker
way
to
ruin
itself
than
by
sudden
adopt
such

and
that
the
safest
rule
of

is
to
take
one
s
charact
and
institut
for
better
and
for
wors

and
to
live
up
to
them
as
close
as
one
can



such
were
the
word
of
alcibiad

after
hear
him
and
the
egestaean
and
some
leontin
exil

who
came
forward
remind
them
of
their
oath
and
implor
their
assist

the
athenian
becam
more
eager
for
the
expedit
than
befor

nicia

perceiv
that
it
would
be
now
useless
to
tri
to
deter
them
by
the
old
line
of
argument

but
think
that
he
might
perhap
alter
their
resolut
by
the
extravag
of
his
estim

came
forward
a
second
time
and
spoke
as
follow



i
see

athenian

that
you
are
thorough
bent
upon
the
expedit

and
therefor
hope
that
all
will
turn
out
as
we
wish

and
proceed
to
give
you
my
opinion
at
the
present
junctur

from
all
that
i
hear
we
are
go
against
citi
that
are
great
and
not
subject
to
one
anoth

or
in
need
of
chang

so
as
to
be
glad
to
pass
from
enforc
servitud
to
an
easier
condit

or
in
the
least
like
to
accept
our
rule
in
exchang
for
freedom

and

to
take
onli
the
hellen
town

they
are
veri
numer
for
one
island

besid
naxo
and
catana

which
i
expect
to
join
us
from
their
connect
with
leontini

there
are
seven
other
arm
at
all
point
just
like
our
own
power

particular
selinus
and
syracus

the
chief
object
of
our
expedit

these
are
full
of
heavi
infantri

archer

and
darter

have
galley
in
abund
and
crowd
to
man
them

they
have
also
money

part
in
the
hand
of
privat
person

part
in
the
templ
at
selinus

and
at
syracus
first
fruit
from
some
of
the
barbarian
as
well

but
their
chief
advantag
over
us
lie
in
the
number
of
their
hors

and
in
the
fact
that
they
grow
their
corn
at
home
instead
of
import
it



against
a
power
of
this
kind
it
will
not
do
to
have
mere
a
weak
naval
armament

but
we
shall
want
also
a
larg
land
armi
to
sail
with
us

if
we
are
to
do
anyth
worthi
of
our
ambit

and
are
not
to
be
shut
out
from
the
countri
by
a
numer
cavalri

especi
if
the
citi
should
take
alarm
and
combin

and
we
should
be
left
without
friend

except
the
egestaean

to
furnish
us
with
hors
to
defend
ourselv
with

it
would
be
disgrac
to
have
to
retir
under
compuls

or
to
send
back
for
reinforc

owe
to
want
of
reflect
at
first

we
must
therefor
start
from
home
with
a
compet
forc

see
that
we
are
go
to
sail
far
from
our
countri

and
upon
an
expedit
not
like
ani
which
you
may
undertaken
undertaken
the
qualiti
of
alli

among
your
subject
state
here
in
hella

where
ani
addit
suppli
need
were
easili
drawn
from
the
friend
territori

but
we
are
cut
ourselv
off

and
go
to
a
land
entir
strang

from
which
dure
four
month
in
winter
it
is
not
even
easi
for
a
messeng
get
to
athen



i
think

therefor

that
we
ought
to
take
great
number
of
heavi
infantri

both
from
athen
and
from
our
alli

and
not
mere
from
our
subject

but
also
ani
we
may
be
abl
to
get
for
love
or
for
money
in
peloponnes

and
great
number
also
of
archer
and
slinger

to
make
head
against
the
sicilian
hors

meanwhil
we
must
have
an
overwhelm
superior
at
sea

to
enabl
us
the
more
easili
to
carri
in
what
we
want

and
we
must
take
our
own
corn
in
merchant
vessel

that
is
to
say

wheat
and
parch
barley

and
baker
from
the
mill
compel
to
serv
for
pay
in
the
proper
proport

in
order
that
in
case
of
our
be
weather
bound
the
armament
may
not
want
provis

as
it
is
not
everi
citi
that
will
be
abl
to
entertain
number
like
our

we
must
also
provid
ourselv
with
everyth
els
as
far
as
we
can

so
as
not
to
be
depend
upon
other

and
abov
all
we
must
take
with
us
from
home
as
much
money
as
possibl

as
the
sum
talk
of
as
readi
at
egesta
are
readier

you
may
be
sure

in
talk
than
in
ani
other
way



indeed

even
if
we
leav
athen
with
a
forc
not
onli
equal
to
that
of
the
enemi
except
in
the
number
of
heavi
infantri
in
the
field

but
even
at
all
point
superior
to
him

we
shall
still
find
it
difficult
to
conquer
sicili
or
save
ourselv

we
must
not
disguis
from
ourselv
that
we
go
to
found
a
citi
among
stranger
and
enemi

and
that
he
who
undertak
such
an
enterpris
should
be
prepar
to
becom
master
of
the
countri
the
first
day
he
land

or
fail
in
this
to
find
everyth
hostil
to
him

fear
this

and
know
that
we
shall
have
need
of
much
good
counsel
and
more
good
fortun

a
hard
matter
for
mortal
man
to
aspir
to

i
wish
as
far
as
may
be
to
make
myself
independ
of
fortun
befor
sail

and
when
i
do
sail

to
be
as
safe
as
a
strong
forc
can
make
me

this
i
believ
to
be
surest
for
the
countri
at
larg

and
safest
for
us
who
are
to
go
on
the
expedit

if
ani
one
think
differ
i
resign
to
him
my
command



with
this
nicia
conclud

think
that
he
should
either
disgust
the
athenian
by
the
magnitud
of
the
undertak

or

if
oblig
to
sail
on
the
expedit

would
thus
do
so
in
the
safest
way
possibl

the
athenian

howev

far
from
have
their
tast
for
the
voyag
taken
away
by
the
burdensom
of
the
prepar

becam
more
eager
for
it
than
ever

and
just
the
contrari
took
place
of
what
nicia
had
thought

as
it
was
held
that
he
had
given
good
advic

and
that
the
expedit
would
be
the
safest
in
the
world

all
alik
fell
in
love
with
the
enterpris

the
older
men
thought
that
they
would
either
subdu
the
place
against
which
they
were
to
sail

or
at
all
event

with
so
larg
a
forc

meet
with
no
disast

those
in
the
prime
of
life
felt
a
long
for
foreign
sight
and
spectacl

and
had
no
doubt
that
they
should
come
safe
home
again

while
the
idea
of
the
common
peopl
and
the
soldieri
was
to
earn
wage
at
the
moment

and
make
conquest
that
would
suppli
a
never
end
fund
of
pay
for
the
futur

with
this
enthusiasm
of
the
major

the
few
that
like
it
not

fear
to
appear
unpatriot
by
hold
up
their
hand
against
it

and
so
kept
quiet


at
last
one
of
the
athenian
came
forward
and
call
upon
nicia
and
told
him
that
he
ought
not
to
make
excus
or
put
them
off

but
say
at
onc
befor
them
all
what
forc
the
athenian
should
vote
him

upon
this
he
said

not
without
reluct

that
he
would
advis
upon
that
matter
more
at
leisur
with
his
colleagu

as
far
howev
as
he
could
see
at
present

they
must
sail
with
at
least
one
hundr
galley

the
athenian
provid
as
mani
transport
as
they
might
determin

and
send
for
other
from
the
alli

not
less
than
five
thousand
heavi
infantri
in
all

athenian

and
if
possibl
more

and
the
rest
of
the

from

and
whatev
els
might
seem
desir

be
got
readi
by
the
general
and
taken
with
them


upon
hear
this
the
athenian
at
onc
vote
that
the
general
should
have
full
power
in
the
matter
of
the
number
of
the

and
of

as

their

reject

put

their

upon
some

charg

which
they
would
the
more
easili
get
up
in

accord
it
was
decre
that
he
should
sail


after
this
the
departur
for

took
place

it
be
now
about
midsumm

most
of
the
alli

with
the
corn
transport
and
the
smaller
craft
and
the
rest
of
the

had
alreadi
receiv
order
to
muster
at
corcyra

to
cross
the
ionian
sea
from
thenc
in
a
bodi
to
the
iapygian
promontori

but
the
athenian
themselv

and
such
of
their
alli
as
happen
to
be
with
them

went
down
to
piraeus
upon
a
day
appoint
at
daybreak

and
began
to
man
the
ship
for
put
out
to
sea

with
them
also
went
down
the
whole
popul

one
may
say

of
the
citi

both
citizen

foreign

the
inhabit
of
the
countri
each
escort
those
that
belong
to

their
friend

their

or
their

with
hope
and
lament
upon
their
way

as
they
thought
of
the
conquest
which
they
hope
to
make

or
of
the
friend
whom
they
might
never
see
again

consid
the
long
voyag
which
they
were
go
to
make
from
their
countri

indeed

at
this
moment

when
they
were
now
upon
the
point
of
part
from
one
anoth

the
danger
came
more
home
to
them
than
when
they
vote
for
the
expedit

although
the
strength
of
the
armament

and
the
profus
provis
which
they
remark
in
everi
depart

was
a
sight
that
could
not
but
comfort
them

as
for
the
foreign
and
the
rest
of
the
crowd

they
simpli
went
to
see
a
sight
worth
look
at
and
pass
all
belief


indeed
this
armament
that
first
sail
out
was
by
far
the
most
cost
and
splendid
hellen
forc
that
had
ever
been
sent
out
by
a
singl
citi
up
to
that
time

in
mere
number
of

heavi

meanwhil
at

news
came
in
from

quarter
of
the

but
for
a
long
while
met
with
no

whatev

indeed

an

was
held
in
which
speech

as
will
be

were
deliv
by
differ

believ

contradict
the
report
of
the
athenian
expedit

among
whom
hermocr

son
of
hermon

came
forward

be
persuad
that
he
knew
the
truth
of
the
matter

and
gave
the
follow
counsel



although
i
shall
perhap
be
no
better
believ
than
other
have
been
when
i
speak
upon
the
realiti
of
the
expedit

and
although
i
know
that
those
who
either
make
or
repeat
statement
thought
not
worthi
of
belief
not
onli
gain
no
convert
but
are
thought
fool
for
their
pain

i
shall
certain
not
be
frighten
into
hold
my
tongu
when
the
state
is
in
danger

and
when
i
am
persuad
that
i
can
speak
with
more
author
on
the
matter
than
other
person

much
as
you
wonder
at
it

the
athenian
nevertheless
have
set
out
against
us
with
a
larg
forc

naval
and
militari

profess
to
help
the
egestaean
and
to
restor
leontini

but
realli
to
conquer
sicili

and
abov
all
our
citi

which
onc
gain

the
rest

they
think

will
easili
follow

make
up
your
mind

therefor

to
see
them
speedili
here

and
see
how
you
can
best
repel
them
with
the
mean
under
your
hand

and
do
be
taken
off
your
guard
through
despis
the
news

or
neglect
the
common
weal
through
disbeliev
it

meanwhil
those
who
believ
me
need
not
be
dismay
at
the
forc
or
dare
of
the
enemi

they
will
not
be
abl
to
do
us
more
hurt
than
we
shall
do
them

nor
is
the
great
of
their
armament
altogeth
without
advantag
to
us

indeed

the
greater
it
is
the
better

with
regard
to
the
rest
of
the
siceliot

whom
dismay
will
make
more
readi
to
join
us

and
if
we
defeat
or
drive
them
away

disappoint
of
the
object
of
their
ambit

for
i
do
not
fear
for
a
moment
that
they
will
get
what
they
want


it
will
be
a
most
glorious
exploit
for
us

and
in
my
judgment
by
no
mean
an
unlik
one

few
inde
have
been
the
larg
armament

either
hellen
or
barbarian

that
have
gone
far
from
home
and
been
success

they
cannot
be
more
numer
than
the
peopl
of
the
countri
and
their
neighbour

all
of
whom
fear
leagu
togeth

and
if
they
miscarri
for
want
of
suppli
in
a
foreign
land

to
those
against
whom
their
plan
were
laid
none
the
less
they
leav
renown

although
they
may
themselv
have
been
the
main
caus
of
their
own
discomfort

thus
these
veri
athenian
rose
by
the
defeat
of
the
mede

in
a
great
measur
due
to
accident
caus

from
the
mere
fact
that
athen
had
been
the
object
of
his
attack

and
this
may
veri
well
be
the
case
with
us
also



let
us

therefor

confid
begin
prepar
here

let
us
send
and
confirm
some
of
the
sicel

and
obtain
the
friendship
and
allianc
of
other

and
dispatch
envoy
to
the
rest
of
sicili
to
show
that
the
danger
is
common
to
all

and
to
itali
to
get
them
to
becom
our
alli

or
at
all
event
to
refus
to
receiv
the
athenian

i
also
think
that
it
would
be
best
to
send
to
carthag
as
well

they
are
by
no
mean
there
without
apprehens

but
it
is
their
constant
fear
that
the
athenian
may
one
day
attack
their
citi

and
they
may
perhap
think
that
they
might
themselv
suffer
by
let
sicili
be
sacrif

and
be
will
to
help
us
secret
if
not
open

in
one
way
if
not
in
anoth

they
are
the
best
abl
to
do
so

if
they
will

of
ani
of
the
present
day

as
they
possess
most
gold
and
silver

by
which
war

like
everyth
els

flourish

let
us
also
send
to
lacedaemon
and
corinth

and
ask
them
to
come
here
and
help
us
as
soon
as
possibl

and
to
keep
aliv
the
war
in
hella

but
the
true
thing
of
all
other

in
my
opinion

to
do
at
the
present
moment

is
what
you

with
your
constitut
love
of
quiet

will
be
slow
to
see

and
what
i
must
nevertheless
mention

if
we
siceliot

all
togeth

or
at
least
as
mani
as
possibl
besid
ourselv

would
onli
launch
the
whole
of
our
actual
navi
with
two
month

provis

and
meet
the
athenian
at
tarentum
and
the
iapygian
promontori

and
show
them
that
befor
fight
for
sicili
they
must
first
fight
for
their
passag
across
the
ionian
sea

we
should
strike
dismay
into
their
armi

and
set
them
on
think
that
we
have
a
base
for
our
defens

for
tarentum
is
readi
to
receiv
us

while
they
have
a
wide
sea
to
cross
with
all
their
armament

which
could
with
difficulti
keep
it
order
through
so
long
a
voyag

and
would
be
easi
for
us
to
attack
as
it
came
on
slowli
and
in
small
detach

on
the
other
hand

if
they
were
to
lighten
their
vessel

and
draw
togeth
their
fast
sailer
and
with
these
attack
us

we
could
either
fall
upon
them
when
they
were
weari
with
row

or
if
we
did
not
choos
to
do
so

we
could
retir
to
tarentum

while
they

have
cross
with
few
provis
just
to
give
battl

would
be
hard
put
to
it
in
desol
place

and
would
either
have
to
remain
and
be
blockad

or
to
tri
to
sail
along
the
coast

abandon
the
rest
of
their
armament

and
be
further
discourag
by
not
know
for
certain
whether
the
citi
would
receiv
them

in
my
opinion
this
consider
alon
would
be
suffici
to
deter
them
from
put
out
from
corcyra

and
what
with
deliber
and
reconnoitr
our
number
and
whereabout

they
would
let
the
season
go
on
until
winter
was
upon
them

or

confound
by
so
unexpect
a
circumst

would
break
up
the
expedit

especi
as
their
most
experienc
general
has

as
i
hear

taken
the
command
against
his
will

and
would
grasp
at
the
first
excus
offer
by
ani
serious
demonstr
of
our

we
should
also
be
report

i
am
certain

as
more
numer
than
we
realli
are

and
men
s
mind
are
affect
by
what
they
hear

and
besid
the
first
to
attack

or
to
show
that
they
mean
to
defend
themselv
against
an
attack

inspir
greater
fear
becaus
men
see
that
they
are
readi
for
the
emerg

this
would
just
be
the
case
with
the
athenian
at
present

they
are
now
attack
us
in
the
belief
that
we
shall
not
resist

have
a
right
to
judg
us
sever
becaus
we
did
not
help
the
lacedaemonian
in
crush
them

but
if
they
were
to
see
us
show
a
courag
for
which
they
are
not
prepar

they
would
be
more
dismay
by
the
surpris
than
they
could
ever
be
by
our
actual
power

i
could
wish
to
persuad
you
to
show
this
courag

but
if
this
cannot
be

at
all
event
lose
not
a
moment
in
prepar
general
for
the
war

and
rememb
all
of
you
that
contempt
for
an
assail
is
best
shown
by
braveri
in
action

but
that
for
the
present
the
best
cours
is
to
accept
the
prepar
which
fear
inspir
as
give
the
surest
promis
of
safeti

and
to
act
as
if
the
danger
was
real

that
the
athenian
are
come
to
attack
us

and
are
alreadi
upon
the
voyag

and
all
but
here

this
is
what
i
am
sure
of



thus
far
spoke
hermocr

meanwhil
the
peopl
of
syracus
were
at
great
strife
among
themselv

some
contend
that
the
athenian
had
no
idea
of
come
and
that
there
was
no
truth
in
what
he
said

some
ask
if
they
did
come
what
harm
they
could
do
that
would
not
be
repaid
them
tenfold
in
return

while
other
made
light
of
the
whole
affair
and
turn
it
into
ridicul

in
short

there
were
few
that
believ
hermocr
and
fear
for
the
futur

meanwhil
athenagora

the
leader
of
the
peopl
and
veri
power
at
that
time
with
the
mass

came
forward
and
spoke
as
follow



for
the
athenian

he
who
doe
not
wish
that
they
may
be
as
misguid
as
they
are
suppos
to
be

and
that
they
may
come
here
to
becom
our
subject

is
either
a
coward
or
a
traitor
to
his
countri

while
as
for
those
who
carri
such
tide
and
fill
you
with
so
much
alarm

i
wonder
less
at
their
audac
than
at
their
folli
if
they
flatter
themselv
that
we
do
not
see
through
them

the
fact
is
that
they
have
their
privat
reason
to
be
afraid

and
wish
to
throw
the
citi
into
constern
to
have
their
own
terror
cast
into
the
shade
by
the
public
alarm

in
short

this
is
what
these
report
are
worth

they
do
not
aris
of
themselv

but
are
concoct
by
men
who
are
alway
caus
agit
here
in
sicili

howev

if
you
are
well
advis

you
will
not
be
guid
in
your
calcul
of
probabl
by
what
these
person
tell
you

but
by
what
shrewd
men
and
of
larg
experi

as
i
esteem
the
athenian
to
be

would
be
like
to
do

now
it
is
not
like
that
they
would
leav
the
peloponnesian
behind
them

and
befor
they
have
well
end
the
war
in
hella
wanton
come
in
quest
of
a
new
war
quit
as
arduous
in
sicili

inde

in
my
judgment

they
are
onli
too
glad
that
we
do
not
go
and
attack
them

be
so
mani
and
so
great
citi
as
we
are



howev

if
they
should
come
as
is
report

i
consid
sicili
better
abl
to
go
through
with
the
war
than
peloponnes

as
be
at
all
point
better
prepar

and
our
citi
by
itself
far
more
than
a
match
for
this
pretend
armi
of
invas

even
were
it
twice
as
larg
again

i
know
that
they
will
not
have
hors
with
them

or
get
ani
here

except
a
few
perhap
from
the
egestaean

or
be
abl
to
bring
a
forc
of
heavi
infantri
equal
in
number
to
our
own

in
ship
which
will
alreadi
have
enough
to
do
to
come
all
this
distanc

howev
light
laden

not
to
speak
of
the
transport
of
the
other
store
requir
against
a
citi
of
this
magnitud

which
will
be
no
slight
quantiti

in
fact

so
strong
is
my
opinion
upon
the
subject

that
i
do
not
well
see
how
they
could
avoid
annihil
if
they
brought
with
them
anoth
citi
as
larg
as
syracus

and
settl
down
and
carri
on
war
from
our
frontier

much
less
can
they
hope
to
succeed
with
all
sicili
hostil
to
them

as
all
sicili
will
be

and
with
onli
a
camp
pitch
from
the
ship

and
compos
of
tent
and
bare
necessari

from
which
they
would
not
be
abl
to
stir
far
for
fear
of
our
cavalri



but
the
athenian
see
this
as
i
tell
you

and
as
i
have
reason
to
know
are
look
after
their
possess
at
home

while
person
here
invent
stori
that
neither
are
true
nor
ever
will
be

nor
is
this
the
first
time
that
i
see
these
person

when
they
cannot
resort
to
deed

tri
by
such
stori
and
by
other
even
more
abomin
to
frighten
your
peopl
and
get
into
their
hand
the
govern

it
is
what
i
see
alway

and
i
cannot
help
fear
that
tri
so
often
they
may
one
day
succeed

and
that
we

as
long
as
we
do
not
feel
the
smart

may
prove
too
weak
for
the
task
of
prevent

or

when
the
offend
are
known

of
pursuit

the
result
is
that
our
citi
is
rare
at
rest

but
is
subject
to
constant
troubl
and
to
contest
as
frequent
against
herself
as
against
the
enemi

not
to
speak
of
occasion
tyranni
and
infam
cabal

howev

i
will
tri

if
you
will
support
me

to
let
noth
of
this
happen
in
our
time

by
gain
you

the
mani

and
by
chastis
the
author
of
such
machin

not

when
they
are
caught
in

a
difficult
feat
to
accomplish

but
also
for
what
they
have
the
wish
though
not
the
power
to
do

as
it
is
necessari
to
punish
an
enemi
not
onli
for
what
he
doe

but
also
beforehand
for
what
he
intend
to
do

if
the
first
to
relax
precaut
would
not
be
also
the
first
to
suffer

i
shall
also
reprov

watch

and
on
occas
warn
the
few

the
most
effectu
way

in
my
opinion

of
turn
them
from
their
evil
cours

and
after
all

as
i
have
often
ask

what
would
you
have

young
men

would
you
hold
offic
at
onc

the
law
forbid
it

a
law
enact
rather
becaus
you
are
not
compet
than
to
disgrac
you
when
compet

meanwhil
you
would
not
be
on
a
legal
equal
with
the
mani

but
how
can
it
be
right
that
citizen
of
the
same
state
should
be
held
unworthi
of
the
same
privileg



it
will
be
said

perhap

that
democraci
is
neither
wise
nor
equit

but
that
the
holder
of
properti
are
also
the
best
fit
to
rule

i
say

on
the
contrari

first

that
the
word
demo

or
peopl

includ
the
whole
state

oligarchi
onli
a
part

next

that
if
the
best
guardian
of
properti
are
the
rich

and
the
best
counsellor
the
wise

none
can
hear
and
decid
so
well
as
the
mani

and
that
all
these
talent

sever
and
collect

have
their
just
place
in
a
democraci

but
an
oligarchi
give
the
mani
their
share
of
the
danger

and
not
content
with
the
largest
part
take
and
keep
the
whole
of
the
profit

and
this
is
what
the
power
and
young
among
you
aspir
to

but
in
a
great
citi
cannot
possibl
obtain



but
even
now

foolish
men

most
senseless
of
all
the
hellen
that
i
know

if
you
have
no
sens
of
the
wicked
of
your
design

or
most
crimin
if
you
have
that
sens
and
still
dare
to
pursu
them

even
now

if
it
is
not
a
case
for
repent

you
may
still
learn
wisdom

and
thus
advanc
the
interest
of
the
countri

the
common
interest
of
us
all

reflect
that
in
the
countri
s
prosper
the
men
of
merit
in
your
rank
will
have
a
share
and
a
larger
share
than
the
great
mass
of
your
fellow
countrymen

but
that
if
you
have
other
design
you
run
a
risk
of
be
depriv
of
all

and
desist
from
report
like
these

as
the
peopl
know
your
object
and
will
not
put
up
with
it

if
the
athenian
arriv

this
citi
will
repuls
them
in
a
manner
worthi
of
itself

we
have
moreov

general
who
will
see
to
this
matter

and
if
noth
of
this
be
true

as
i
inclin
to
believ

the
citi
will
not
be
thrown
into
a
panic
by
your
intellig

or
impos
upon
itself
a
self
chosen
servitud
by
choos
you
for
it
ruler

the
citi
itself
will
look
into
the
matter

and
will
judg
your
word
as
if
they
were
act

and

instead
of
allow
itself
to
be
depriv
of
it
liberti
by
listen
to
you

will
strive
to
preserv
that
liberti

by
take
care
to
have
alway
at

the

of

respect



such
were
the
word
of
athenagora

one
of

now
stood
up

stop
ani
other

come
forward

ad
these
word
of

it
is
not
well
for
speaker
to
utter
calumni
against
one
anoth

or
for
their
hearer
to
entertain
them

we
ought
rather
to
look
to
the
intellig
that
we
have
receiv

and
see
how
each
man
by
himself
and
the
citi
as
a

may
best
prepar

repel
the
invad

even
if
there
be
no

there
is
no

in

be
furnish

we

and
by

of

the

they
had

tri
to

had
had
most
reason
to

from
their

constant

for

if

his

had
had
recours

when
the

they

everywher
a

the
effect
was
most
dazzl
upon
the
athenian
sailor

and
made

talk
loud
of

had
seen
when
they
got

much

meanwhil
the

consult
upon
what
was

the
opinion
of

was
to
sail
with

the
main
object
of

and
if
the

could
provid

then
to

display
the
power
of

prove
their
zeal
for

to

unless

should
have

unexpect
opportun
of

alcibiad
said
that
a

expedit
like
the
present
must
not
disgrac
itself
by
go
away
without

done
anyth

herald
must
be
sent
to
all
the

except
selinus

syracus

and
effort
be
made
to
make
some
of
the
sicel
revolt
from
the
syracusan

and
to
obtain
the
friendship
of
other

in
order
to
have
corn

and
first
of

to
gain
the
messines

who
lay
right
in
the
passag
and
entranc
to
sicili

and
would
afford
an
excel
harbour
and
base
for

thus

after
bring
over
the
town
and
know
who
would
be
their
alli
in
the
war

they
might
at
length
attack
syracus
and
selinus

unless
the

came
to

and
the

ceas
to

lamachus

on

said
that
they
ought
to

straight
to

and
fight
their

at

under

of

while
the

were
still
unprepar

and
the

at

was
most
terribl
at

if
it

to

reviv

and
they
saw
it
appear
at

almost
with
indiffer

by

sudden

while
syracus
still
trembl
at
their
come

they
would
have
the
best
chanc
of
gain
a
victori
for
themselv
and
of
strike
a
complet
panic
into
the
enemi
by
the
aspect
of

which
would
never
appear
so
consider
as
at

by

they
might
also
count
upon

in

outsid

incredul
of

and
at
the
moment
that
the
enemi
was
carri
in
his
properti
the

would
not
want
for
booti
if
it
sat
down
in

befor
the

the
rest
of

siceliot
would
thus
be
immedi
less
dispos

enter
into

with
the
syracusan

and
would
join
the
athenian

without
wait
to
see
which
were
the
strongest

they
must
make
megara
their
naval
station
as
a

it
was
an

after

pisistratus

the

sent
up

of

in

of
apollo
pythia


that
hippia
was
the

succeed
to
the
govern

is
what
i
posit
assert
as
a
fact
upon
which
i
have
had
more
exact
account
than
other

and
may
be
also
ascertain
by
the
follow
circumst

he
is
the
onli
one
of
the
legitim
brother
that
appear
to
have
had
children

as
the

show

and
the

place
in
the
athenian
acropoli

commemor
the
crime
of
the
tyrant

which
mention
no
child
of
thessalus
or
of
hipparchus

but
five
of
hippia

which
he
had
by
myrrhin

daughter
of
callia

son
of
hyperechid

and
natur
the
eldest
would
have
marri
first

again

his
name
come
first
on
the
pillar
after
that
of
his

and
this
too
is
quit
natur

as
he
was
the
eldest
after
him

and
the
reign
tyrant

nor
can
i
ever
believ
that
hippia
would
have
obtain
the

easili

if
hipparchus
had
been
in

when

hippia

but
he
had
no

been
long
accustom
to
overaw
the

and
to
be

and
thus
not

conquer

enabl

no

of

some

they
sent

a

and
by
the
syracusan
general
thought
to
be
no

in

he
was
a

and
said
he
came
from
person
in

whose

the

general
were
acquaint

and
whom
they
knew
to

he
told
them
that
the
athenian
pass
the
night
in

at

and
that
if
the

would
name
a
day

come
with
all
their

at

to
attack
the

they

their

would
close

and
set
fire
to
the
vessel

while
the
syracusan
would
easili
take

in

they

from

a

to

in
the

battl

the
forc
itself
be

to
my

more
fit
to
inspir
confid
than
a
fine

with

where
we
have
argive

mantinean

athenian

the

it
were
strang
inde

with

if

especi
when

oppos

what
is
more

siceliot

who
may
disdain
us
but
will
not
stand

their
skill
not
be
at
all
commensur
to

you
may
also
rememb
that
we
are
far

have
no

land
near

except
what
your

shall
win
you

and
here
i
put
befor
you
a
motiv
just
the
revers
of
that
which
the

are
appeal
to

their

be
that

mine
that

therefor

your

after
this
address
nicia
at

led

the
syracusan
were
not

was
close

ran

though
behind

took
their

in

bodi
as

as
they

it

want
of
zeal
or

was
certain
not
the
fault
of
the
syracusan

either
in

the

battl

but
although
not
inferior
in

so
far
as

carri

when

they
were
compel
to

on

occas

although
they

not

although
constrain

should

with

for

meanwhil
the

burn

then
held

with

had
given

brilliant

in

came
forward

encourag

and
told
them
not

let
what
had
occur
make
them
give
way

sinc
their
spirit
had
not
been

but
their
want

had
done
the
mischief

still
they
had
not
been
beaten
by
so
much
as
might
have
been
expect

especi

one
might
say

novic
in

an

oppos

the
most
practis

in

what
had
also
done
great
mischief
was
the
number
of

there
were
fifteen
of

and
the
quantiti
of
order
given

combin

courag

alreadi
their

disciplin

have
thus
been
ad

it

indeed

both
these
qualiti
would
improv

sinc
danger
would
exercis
them
in
disciplin

while
their
courag
would
be
led
to
surpass

by
the
confid

skill
inspir

the

and
an

if

their

rather
of

they

with

the
intent
which
we
all
suspect

in
my
opinion
less
to
restor
the
leontin
to
their

than
to
oust

from

as
it
is
out
of
all

that

the

that

or
should

that
could
be
found

until
they
thus
subdu
them
all

in

in
the
struggl
against

the
athenian
did
not
fight
for
the
liberti
of

or
the

for

the

to

the

to

wiser

we

declar
to

familiar
with

the
misde
of
a

so
open
to

is

know

that
in

or
that

will

as
for
the
camarinaean
who
say
that
it
is

syracusan

not
he

that
is
the

of

athenian

and
who
think
it
hard
to

risk
in

i
would
have
him
bear
in
mind
that
he
will
fight
in
my

not
more
for

than
for
his

and
by
so
much
the
more
safe
in
that
he
will
enter
on
the

not
alon

after
the
way
has
been
clear
by
my
ruin

but
with
me
as
his
alli

and
that
the
object
of
the
athenian
is
not
so
much
to
punish
the
enmiti
of
the
syracusan
as
to
use
me
as
a

to
secur
the

of
the
camarinaean

as
for
him
who
envi
or
even
fear

and
envi
and
fear
great
power
must
alway
be


and
who
on
this
account
wish
syracus
to
be
humbl
to
teach
us
a
lesson

but
would
still
have
her
surviv

in
the

of

the

possibl

a

in

he
may
live

not

for

what
is
nomin
the

be

it
was
to
be
expect
that
you

of
all
peopl
in
the
world

camarinaean

be
our
immedi
neighbour
and
the
next
in

would
have
foreseen
this

and
instead
of
support
us
in
the
lukewarm
way
that
you
are
now
do

would
rather
come
to
us
of
your
own
accord

and
be
now
offer
at
syracus
the
aid
which
you
would
have
ask
for
at
camarina

if
to
camarina
the
athenian
had
first
come

to
encourag
us
to
resist
the
invad

neither
you

howev

nor
the
rest
have
as
yet
bestir
yourselv
in
this
direct



fear
perhap
will
make
you
studi
to
do
right
both
by
us
and
by
the
invad

and
plead
that
you
have
an
allianc
with
the
athenian

but
you
made
that
allianc

not
against
your
friend

but
against
the
enemi
that
might
attack
you

and
to
help
the
athenian
when
they
were
wrong
by
other

not
when
as
now
they
are
wrong
their
neighbour

even
the
rhegian

chalcidian
though
they
be

refus
to
help
to
restor
the
chalcidian
leontin

and
it
would
be
strang
if

while
they
suspect
the
gist
of
this
fine
pretenc
and
are
wise
without
reason

you

with
everi
reason
on
your
side

should
yet
choos
to
assist
your
natur
enemi

and
should
join
with
their
direst
foe
in
undo
those
whom
natur
has
made
your
own
kinsfolk

this
is
not
to
do
right

but
you
should
help
us
without
fear
of
their
armament

which
has
no
terror
if
we
hold
togeth

but
onli
if
we
let
them
succeed
in
their
endeavour
to
separ
us

sinc
even
after
attack
us
by
ourselv
and
be
victori
in
battl

they
had
to
go
off
without
effect
their
purpos



unite

therefor

we
have
no
caus
to
despair

but
rather
new
encourag
to
leagu
togeth

especi
as
succour
will
come
to
us
from
the
peloponnesian

in
militari
matter
the
undoubt
superior
of
the
athenian

and
you
need
not
think
that
your
prudent
polici
of
take
side
with
neither

becaus
alli
of
both

is
either
safe
for
you
or
fair
to
us

practic
it
is
not
as
fair
as
it
pretend
to
be

if
the
vanquish
be
defeat

and
the
victor
conquer

through
your
refus
to
join

what
is
the
effect
of
your
abstent
but
to
leav
the
former
to
perish
unaid

and
to
allow
the
latter
to
offend
unhind

and
yet
it
were
more
honour
to
join
those
who
are
not
onli
the
injur
parti

but
your
own
kindr

and
by
so
do
to
defend
the
common
interest
of
sicili
and
save
your
friend
the
athenian
from
do
wrong



in
conclus

we
syracusan
say
that
it
is
useless
for
us
to
demonstr
either
to
you
or
to
the
rest
what
you
know
alreadi
as
well
as
we
do

but
we
entreat

and
if
our
entreati
fail

we
protest
that
we
are
menac
by
our
etern
enemi
the
ionian

and
are
betray
by
you
our
fellow
dorian

if
the
athenian
reduc
us

they
will
owe
their
victori
to
your
decis

but
in
their
own
name
will
reap
the
honour

and
will
receiv
as
the
prize
of
their
triumph
the
veri
men
who
enabl
them
to
gain
it

on
the
other
hand

if
we
are
the
conqueror

you
will
have
to
pay
for
have
been
the
caus
of
our
danger

consid

therefor

and
now
make
your
choic
between
the
secur
which
present
servitud
offer
and
the
prospect
of
conquer
with
us
and
so
escap
disgrac
submiss
to
an
athenian
master
and
avoid
the
last
enmiti
of
syracus



such
were
the
word
of
hermocr

after
whom
euphemus

the
athenian
ambassador

spoke
as
follow



although
we
came
here
onli
to
renew
the
former
allianc

the
attack
of
the
syracusan
compel
us
to
speak
of
our
empir
and
of
the
good
right
we
have
to
it

the
best
proof
of
this
the
speaker
himself
furnish

when
he
call
the
ionian
etern
enemi
of
the
dorian

it
is
the
fact

and
the
peloponnesian
dorian
be
our
superior
in
number
and
next
neighbour

we
ionian
look
out
for
the
best
mean
of
escap
their
domin

after
the
median
war
we
had
a
fleet

and
so
got
rid
of
the
empir
and
supremaci
of
the
lacedaemonian

who
had
no
right
to
give
order
to
us
more
than
we
to
them

except
that
of
be
the
strongest
at
that
moment

and
be
appoint
leader
of
the
king
s
former
subject

we
continu
to
be
so

think
that
we
are
least
like
to
fall
under
the
dominion
of
the
peloponnesian

if
we
have
a
forc
to
defend
ourselv
with

and
in
strict
truth
have
done
noth
unfair
in
reduc
to
subject
the
ionian
and
island

the
kinsfolk
whom
the
syracusan
say
we
have
enslav

they

our
kinsfolk

came
against
their
mother
countri

that
is
to
say
against
us

togeth
with
the
mede

and

instead
of
have
the
courag
to
revolt
and
sacrific
their
properti
as
we
did
when
we
abandon
our
citi

chose
to
be
slave
themselv

and
to
tri
to
make
us
so



we

therefor

deserv
to
rule
becaus
we
place
the
largest
fleet
and
an
unflinch
patriot
at
the
servic
of
the
hellen

and
becaus
these

our
subject

did
us
mischief
by
their
readi
subservi
to
the
mede

and

desert
apart

we
seek
to
strengthen
ourselv
against
the
peloponnesian

we
make
no
fine
profess
of
have
a
right
to
rule
becaus
we
overthrew
the
barbarian
singl
hand

or
becaus
we
risk
what
we
did
risk
for
the
freedom
of
the
subject
in
question
ani
more
than
for
that
of
all

and
for
our
own

no
one
can
be
quarrel
with
for
provid
for
his
proper
safeti

if
we
are
now
here
in
sicili

it
is
equal
in
the
interest
of
our
secur

with
which
we
perceiv
that
your
interest
also
coincid

we
prove
this
from
the
conduct
which
the
syracusan
cast
against
us
and
which
you
somewhat
too
timor
suspect

know
that
those
whom
fear
has
made
suspici
may
be
carri
away
by
the
charm
of
eloqu
for
the
moment

but
when
they
come
to
act
follow
their
interest



now

as
we
have
said

fear
make
us
hold
our
empir
in
hella

and
fear
make
us
now
come

with
the
help
of
our
friend

to
order
safe
matter
in
sicili

and
not
to
enslav
ani
but
rather
to
prevent
ani
from
be
enslav

meanwhil

let
no
one
imagin
that
we
are
interest
ourselv
in
you
without
your
have
anyth
to
do
with
us

see
that

if
you
are
preserv
and
abl
to
make
head
against
the
syracusan

they
will
be
less
like
to
harm
us
by
send
troop
to
the
peloponnesian

in
this
way
you
have
everyth
to
do
with
us

and
on
this
account
it
is
perfect
reason
for
us
to
restor
the
leontin

and
to
make
them

not
subject
like
their
kinsmen
in
euboea

but
as
power
as
possibl

to
help
us
by
annoy
the
syracusan
from
their
frontier

in
hella
we
are
alon
a
match
for
our
enemi

and
as
for
the
assert
that
it
is
out
of
all
reason
that
we
should
free
the
sicilian

while
we
enslav
the
chalcidian

the
fact
is
that
the
latter
is
use
to
us
by
be
without
arm
and
contribut
money
onli

while
the
former

the
leontin
and
our
other
friend

cannot
be
too
independ



besid

for
tyrant
and
imperi
citi
noth
is
unreason
if
expedi

no
one
a
kinsman
unless
sure

but
friendship
or
enmiti
is
everywher
an
affair
of
time
and
circumst

here

in
sicili

our
interest
is
not
to
weaken
our
friend

but
by
mean
of
their
strength
to
crippl
our
enemi

whi
doubt
this

in
hella
we
treat
our
alli
as
we
find
them
use

the
chian
and
methymnian
govern
themselv
and
furnish
ship

most
of
the
rest
have
harder
term
and
pay
tribut
in
money

while
other

although
island
and
easi
for
us
to
take

are
free
altogeth

becaus
they
occupi
conveni
posit
round
peloponnes

in
our
settlement
of
the
state
here
in
sicili

we
should
therefor

natur
be
guid
by
our
interest

and
by
fear

as
we
say

of
the
syracusan

their
ambit
is
to
rule
you

their
object
to
use
the
suspicion
that
we
excit
to
unit
you

and
then

when
we
have
gone
away
without
effect
anyth

by
forc
or
through
your
isol

to
becom
the
master
of
sicili

and
master
they
must
becom

if
you
unit
with
them

as
a
forc
of
that
magnitud
would
be
no
longer
easi
for
us
to
deal
with
unit

and
they
would
be
more
than
a
match
for
you
as
soon
as
we
were
away



ani
other
view
of
the
case
is
condemn
by
the
fact

when
you
first
ask
us
over

the
fear
which
you
held
out
was
that
of
danger
to
athen
if
we
let
you
come
under
the
dominion
of
syracus

and
it
is
not
right
now
to
mistrust
the
veri
same
argument
by
which
you
claim
to
convinc
us

or
to
give
way
to
suspicion
becaus
we
are
come
with
a
larger
forc
against
the
power
of
that
citi

those
whom
you
should
realli
distrust
are
the
syracusan

we
are
not
abl
to
stay
here
without
you

and
if
we
prove
perfidi
enough
to
bring
you
into
subject

we
should
be
unabl
to
keep
you
in
bondag

owe
to
the
length
of
the
voyag
and
the
difficulti
of
guard
larg

and
in
a
militari
sens
continent

town

they

the
syracusan

live
close
to
you

not
in
a
camp

but
in
a
citi
greater
than
the
forc
we
have
with
us

plot
alway
against
you

never
let
slip
an
opportun
onc
offer

as
they
have
shown
in
the
case
of
the
leontin
and
other

and
now
have
the
face

just
as
if
you
were
fool

to
invit
you
to
aid
them
against
the
power
that
hinder
this

and
that
has
thus
far
maintain
sicili
independ

we

as
against
them

invit
you
to
a
much
more
real
safeti

when
we
beg
you
not
to
betray
that
common
safeti
which
we
each
have
in
the
other

and
to
reflect
that
they

even
without
alli

will

by
their
number

have
alway
the
way
open
to
you

while
you
will
not
often
have
the
opportun
of
defend
yourselv
with
such
numer
auxiliari

if

through
your
suspicion

you
onc
let
these
go

you
will
wish
to
see

you

we
assert

that
we

becaus
we

and
that
now

as
befor

we
are
come
as
alli
to
those
of
you
who
suffer
wrong
in
this
island

not
without

upon

instead
of

yourselv

of
our
conduct

and
tri

which
it
were
now
difficult
to

so

as
there

or
in

that
chime

unit
with

and
in
your
turn
at
last
threaten
them



such
were
the
word
of
euphemus

what
the
camarinaean
felt
was
this

sympath
with
the
athenian

except
in
so
far
as
they
might
be
afraid
of
their

they
had
alway
been
at

with
their

syracus

from
the
veri

howev

that
they
were

they
fear
the

both
sent

for

to

most
in

although
as
spare
as
possibl

but
for
the
moment
in
order
not
to
seem
to
slight
the
athenian

especi
as
they
had
been

in
the

stay
there

press
all

show
no

alcibiad
now
came
forward
and
inflam
and
stir
the
lacedaemonian
by
speak
as
follow



i
am
forc
first
to
speak
to
you
of
the
prejudic
with
which
i
am
regard

in
order
that
suspicion
may
not
make
you
disinclin
to
listen
to
me
upon
public
matter

the
connect

with
you
as
your
proxeni

which
the
ancestor
of
our
famili
by
reason
of
some
discont
renounc

i
person
tri
to
renew
by
my
good
offic
toward
you

in
particular
upon
the
occas
of
the
disast
at
pylo

but
although
i
maintain
this
friend
attitud

you
yet
chose
to
negoti
the
peac
with
the
athenian
through
my
enemi

and
thus
to
strengthen
them
and
to
discredit
me

you
had
therefor
no
right
to
complain
if
i
turn
to
the
mantinean
and
argive

and
seiz
other
occas
of
thwart
and
injur
you

and
the
time
has
now
come
when
those
among
you

who
in
the
bitter
of
the
moment
may
have
been
then
unfair
angri
with
me

should
look
at
the
matter
in
it
true
light

and
take
a
differ
view

those
again
who
judg
me
unfavour

becaus
i
lean
rather
to
the
side
of
the
common

must
not
think
that
their
dislik
is
ani
better
found

we
have
alway
been
hostil
to
tyrant

and
all
who
oppos
arbitrari
power
are
call
common

henc
we
continu
to
act
as
leader
of
the
multitud

besid
which

as
democraci
was
the
govern
of
the
citi

it
was
necessari
in
most
thing
to
conform
to
establish
condit

howev

we
endeavour
to
be
more
moder
than
the
licenti
temper
of
the
time

and
while
there
were
other

former
as
now

who
tri
to
lead
the
multitud
astray

the
same
who
banish
me

our
parti
was
that
of
the
whole
peopl

our
creed
be
to
do
our
part
in
preserv
the
form
of
govern
under
which
the
citi
enjoy
the
utmost
great
and
freedom

and
which
we
had
found
exist

as
for
democraci

the
men
of
sens
among
us
knew
what
it
was

and
i
perhap
as
well
as
ani

as
i
have
the
more
caus
to
complain
of
it

but
there
is
noth
new
to
be
said
of
a
patent
absurd

meanwhil
we
did
not
think
it
safe
to
alter
it
under
the
pressur
of
your
hostil



so
much
then
for
the
prejudic
with
which
i
am
regard

i
now
can
call
your
attent
to
the
question
you
must
consid

and
upon
which
superior
knowledg
perhap
permit
me
to
speak

we
sail
to
sicili
first
to
conquer

if
possibl

the
siceliot

and
after
them
the
italiot
also

and
final
to
assail
the
empir
and
citi
of
carthag

in
the
event
of
all
or
most
of
these
scheme
succeed

we
were
then
to
attack
peloponnes

bring
with
us
the
entir
forc
of
the
hellen
late
acquir
in
those
part

and
take
a
number
of
barbarian
into
our
pay

such
as
the
iberian
and
other
in
those
countri

confess
the
most
warlik
known

and
build
numer
galley
in
addit
to
those
which
we
had
alreadi

timber
be
plenti
in
itali

and
with
this
fleet
blockad
peloponnes
from
the

and
assail
it
with
our
armi
by
land

take
some
of
the
citi
by

draw
work
of
circumval
round

we
hope
without
difficulti
to

it
reduct

and
after
this
to
rule
the
whole

the
hellen
name

money
and
corn
meanwhil
for
the

execut
of
these
plan
were
to
be
suppli
in

quantiti
by
the
newli
acquir
place
in

independ
of
our

here
at

you
have
thus
heard
the
histori
of
the
present
expedit
from
the
man
who
most
exact
know
what
our
object
were

and
the
remain
general
will

if
they
can

carri
these
out
just
the
same

but
that
the
state
in
sicili
must
succumb
if
you
do
not
help
them

i
will
now
show

although
the
siceliot

with
all
their
inexperi

might
even
now
be
save
if
their
forc
were
unit

the
syracusan
alon

beaten
alreadi
in
one
battl
with
all
their
peopl
and
blockad
from
the
sea

will
be
unabl
to
withstand
the
athenian
armament
that
is
now
there

but
if
syracus
fall

all
sicili
fall
also

and
itali
immedi
afterward

and
the
danger
which
i
just
now
spoke
of
from
that
quarter
will
befor
long
be
upon
you

none
need
therefor
fanci
that
sicili
onli
is
in
question

peloponnes
will
be
so
also

unless
you
speedili
do
as
i
tell
you

and
send
on
board
ship
to
syracus
troop
that
shall
abl
to
row
their

themselv

and
serv
as
heavi
infantri
the

that
they

and
what
i
consid
even
more
import

the

a
spartan
as
command
offic
to
disciplin
the
forc
alreadi
on
foot
and
to
compel
recus
to
serv

the
friend
that
you
have
alreadi
will
thus
becom
more
confid

and
the
waver
will
be
encourag
to
join
you

meanwhil
you
must
carri
on
the
war
here
more
open

that
the
syracusan

see
that
you
do
not
forget
them

may
put
heart
into
their
resist

and
that
the
athenian
may
be
less
abl
to
reinforc
their
armament

you
must
fortifi
decelea
in
attica

the
blow
of
which
the
athenian
are
alway
most
afraid
and
the
onli
one
that
they
think
they
have
not
experienc
in
the
present
war

the
surest
method
of
harm
an
enemi
be
to
find
out
what
he
most
fear

and
to
choos
this
mean
of
attack
him

sinc
everi

his

the

while

whatev

there
is
in

will
most
of
it
becom
your

and
the
athenian
will
at

their

at

of
their
present

from

and
abov
all
of

from
their

which
will
be
paid
less
regular

as
they
lose
their
awe
of

see
you

yourselv
with

to
the

the

and

with

depend

lacedaemonian

upon

as
to

possibl

i

i

meanwhil
i

none

the

if

after
have
hitherto

i

activ
join
it

or
will
suspect
what
i
say
as
the
fruit
of
an

s

i
am
an
outlaw
from
the
iniqu

those
who
drove

forth

not

if
you
will
be
guid
by
me

from

my
worst

are
not
you
who
onli
harm
your

but
they
who
forc
their

to
becom
enemi

and
love
of

is
what
i
do
not
feel
when
i

but
what
i
felt
when
secur
in
my

as

indeed
i
do
not
consid

i

now
attack

i
am
rather
tri
to
recov

that

no

and
the
true
lover
of
his

is
not
he
who
consent
to
lose

unjust
rather
than
attack
it

but
he
who
long
for
it
so
much
that
he
will
go
all

to
recov
it

for
myself

therefor

lacedaemonian

i
beg
you
to
use
me
without
scrupl
for
danger
and
troubl
of
everi

and
to
rememb
the
argument
in
everi

that
if
i
did
you
great
harm
as
an

i
could
likewis
do
you
good

as

inasmuch
as
i

of

while
i
onli
guess
your

for

i
entreat
you
to
believ
that
your

you
to

without

the

to
sicili

attica

by
the
presenc

you
will
save
import

and
you
will
destroy
the

both

after

you
will
dwell
in

enjoy

recov

form
in

gylippus
halt
at

distanc
off

sent
on
a

to
tell

that

if

would
evacu

within
five
day

time

he
was
will
to
make
a

accord

the
athenian
treat
this
proposit
with
contempt

and
dismiss
the
herald
without
an

after
this
both
side
began
to
prepar
for

gylippus

observ
that
the
syracusan
were
in
disord
and
did
not
easili
fall
into

drew
off
his
troop
more
into
the
open
ground

while
nicia
did
not
lead
on
the
athenian
but
lay
still
by
his
own
wall

when
gylippus
saw
that
they
did
not
come
on

he
led
off
his
armi
to
the
citadel
of
the
quarter
of
apollo
temenit

and
pass
the
night
there

on
the
follow
day

led

draw
them
up

dispatch
a
strong
forc
against

labdalum

and
took
it

and
put
all
whom
he
found
in
it
to
the
sword

the
place
not
be
within
sight
of
the
athenian

on
the
same
day
an
athenian
galley
that
lay
moor
off
the
harbour
was
captur
by
the
syracusan


after
this
the
syracusan
and
their
alli
began
to
carri
a
singl
wall

start
from
the
citi

in
a
slant
direct
up
epipola

in
order
that
the
athenian

unless
they
could
hinder
the
work

might
be
no
longer
abl
to
invest
them

meanwhil
the
athenian

have
now
finish
their

down

had
come
up
to
the
height

and
part
of

be

gylippus
drew
out
his
armi
by
night
and
attack
it

howev

the
athenian
who
happen
to
be
bivouack
outsid
took
the
alarm
and
came
out
to
meet
him

upon
see
which
he
quick
led
his
men
back
again

the
athenian
now
built
their
wall
higher

and
in

kept

point
themselv

dispos
their
confeder

at

nicia
also
determin
to
fortifi
plemmyrium

a
promontori
over
against
the
citi

which
jut
out
and
narrow
the
mouth
of
the
great
harbour

he
thought
that
the
fortif
of
this
place
would
make
it
easier
to
bring
in
suppli

as
they
would
be
abl
to
carri
on
their
blockad
from
a
less

near
to
the

occupi
by
the
syracusan

instead
of

oblig

upon

movement
of
the
enemi
s
navi

to
put
out
against
them
from
the
bottom
of
the
great

besid
this

he
now
began
to
pay
more
attent
to
the
war
by
sea

see
that
the
come
of
gylippus
had
diminish
their
hope
by
land

accord

he
convey
over
his
ship
and
some
troop

and
built
three
fort
in
which
he
place
most
of
his
baggag

and
moor
there
for
the
futur
the
larger
craft
and
men
of

this
was
the
first
and
chief
occas
of
the
loss
which
the
crew
experienc

the
water
which
they
use
was
scarc
and
had
to
be
fetch
from
far

and
the
sailor
could
not
go
out
for
firewood
without
be
cut
off
by
the
syracusan

who
were
master

meanwhil
nicia
learn
that
the

sent
twenti

with

to

went
on
with

use
the
stone
which
the
athenian
had
laid
down
for

and
at
the

time
constant
led
out
the
syracusan
and
their
alli

and
form
them
in
order
of
battl
in
front
of
the
line

the
athenian
form
against
him

at
last
he
thought
that
the
moment
was
come

and
began
the
attack

and
a
hand
to
hand
fight
ensu
between
the
line

where
the
syracusan
cavalri
could
be
of
no
use

and
the
syracusan
and
their
alli
were
defeat
and
took
up
their
dead
under
truce

while
the
athenian
erect
a
trophi

after
this
gylippus
call
the
soldier
togeth

and
said
that
the
fault
was
not
their
but
his

he
had
kept
their
line
too
much
within
the
work

and
had
thus
depriv
them
of
the
servic
of
their
cavalri
and
darter

he
would
now

therefor

lead
them
on
a
second
time

he
beg
them
to
rememb
that
in
materi
forc
they
would
be
fulli
a
match
for
their
oppon

while

with
respect
to
moral
advantag

it
were
intoler
if
peloponnesian

dorian
should
not
feel
confid
of
overcom
ionian
and

with
the
motley
rabbl
that
accompani
them

and
of
drive
them
out

after
this
he
embrac
the
first
opportun
that
offer
of
again
lead
them
against
the
enemi

now
nicia
and
the
athenian
held
the
opinion
that
even
if
the
syracusan
should
not
wish
to
offer
battl

it
was
necessari
for
them
to
prevent
the
build
of
the
cross
wall

as
it
alreadi
almost
overlap
the
extrem
point
of
their
own

and
if
it
went
ani
further
it
would
from
that
moment
make
no
differ
whether
they
fought
ever
so
mani
success
action

or
never
fought
at
all

they
accord
came
out
to
meet
the
syracusan

gylippus
led
out
his
heavi
infantri
further
from

on
the
former
occas

and
so
join
battl

post
his
hors
and
darter
upon
the

of

athenian
in

driven
headlong
within
their
line

the
night
follow
the
syracusan
carri
their

up
to
the
athenian

pass

thus
put
it
out
of

we

and
compel

we
have
now

therefor

been

by

to
discontinu

until

you

indeed

they

and
were

the

our

to
desert

our
foreign

are
impress
by
the
unexpect
appear
of

and
the

of

such

thus
they
have
ruin

now
i
need
not
remind
you
that
the
time
dure
which
a
crew
is
in
it
prime
is
short

and
that
the
number
of
sailor
who
can
start
a
ship
on
her
way
and
keep
the
row
in
time
is
small

but
by
far
my
greatest
troubl
is

that
hold
the
post
which
i
do

i
am
prevent
by
the
natur
indocil
of
the
athenian
seaman
from
put
a
stop
to
these
evil

and
that
meanwhil
we
have
no
sourc
from
which
to
recruit
our
crew

which
the
enemi
can
do
from
mani
quarter

but
are
compel
to
depend
both
for
suppli
the
crew
in
servic
and
for
make
good
our
loss
upon
the
men
whom
we
brought
with
us

for
our
present
confeder

naxo
and
catana

are
incap
of
suppli
us

there
is
onli
one
thing
more
want
to
our
oppon

i
mean
the
defect
of
our
italian
market

if
they
were
to
see
you
neglect
to
reliev
us
from
our
present
condit

and
were
to
go
over
to
the
enemi

famin
would
compel
us
to
evacu

and
syracus
would
finish
the
war
without
a
blow



i
might

it
is
true

have
written
to
you
someth
differ
and
more
agreeabl
than
this

but
noth
certain
more
use

if
it
is
desir
for
you
to
know
the
real
state
of
thing
here
befor
take
your
measur

besid
i
know
that
it
is
your
natur
to
love
to
be
told
the
best
side
of

and
then
to
blame
the
teller
if
the
expect
which
he
has
rais
in
your
mind
are
not
answer
by
the
result

and
i
therefor
thought
it
safest
to
declar
to
you
the
truth



now
you
are
not
to
think
that
either
your
general
or
your
soldier
have
ceas
to
be
a
match
for
the
forc
origin
oppos
to
them

but
you
are
to
reflect
that
a
general
sicilian
coalit
is
be
form
against
us

that
a
fresh
armi
is
expect
from
peloponnes

while
the
forc
we
have
here
is
unabl
to
cope
even
with
our

and
you
must
prompt
decid
either
to
recal
us
or
to
send

anoth
fleet
and

as

again

with
a

and
someon
to

as
a

in

unfit

for

my

i
have

i

some
claim
on
your

as
while
i
was
in
my

i
did
you
much
good
servic
in
my

but
whatev
you
mean
to
do

do
it
at
the
commenc
of
spring
and
without
delay

as
the
enemi
will
obtain
his
sicilian
reinforc
short

those
from
peloponnes
after
a
longer
interv

and
unless
you
attend
to
the

the

will
be

befor

while
the

will

they
consid

the

both
on

as
the

vessel
were
station
there

it

and
noth
could
be
brought
in
without

besid
the
general
impress
of
dismay
and
discourag
produc
upon

after
this
the
syracusan
sent
out
twelv
ship
under
the
command
of
agatharchus

a
syracusan

one
of
these
went
to
peloponnes
with
ambassador
to
describ
the
hope
state
of
their
affair

and
to
incit
the
peloponnesian
to
prosecut
the

there
even
more
activ
than
they
were
now
do

while
the
eleven
other
sail
to
itali

hear
that
vessel
laden
with
store
were
on
their
way
to
the
athenian

after
fall
in
with
and
destroy
most
of
the
vessel
in
question

and
burn
in
the
caulonian
territori
a
quantiti
of
timber
for
shipbuild

which
had
been
got
readi
for
the
athenian

the
syracusan
squadron
went
to
locri

and
one
of
the
merchantmen
from
peloponnes
come
in

while
they
were
at
anchor
there

carri
thespian
heavi
infantri

took
these
on
board
and
sail
alongshor
toward
home

the
athenian
were
on
the
look
out
for
them
with
twenti
ship
at
megara

but
were
onli
abl
to
take
one
vessel
with
it
crew

the
rest
get
clear
off
to
syracus

there
was
also
some
skirmish
in
the
harbour
about
the
pile
which
the
syracusan
had
driven
in
the
sea
in
front
of
the
old
dock

to
allow
their
ship
to
lie
at
anchor
insid

without
be
hurt
by
the
athenian
sail
up
and
run
them
down

the
athenian
brought
up
to
them
a
ship
of
ten
thousand
talent
burden
furnish
with
wooden
turret
and
screen

and
fasten
rope
round
the
pile
from
their
boat

wrench
them
up
and
broke
them

or
dive
down
and
saw
them
in
two

meanwhil
the
syracusan
pli
them
with
missil
from
the
dock

to
which
they
repli
from
their
larg
vessel

until
at
last
most
of
the
pile
were
remov
by
the
athenian

but
the
most
awkward
part
of
the
stockad
was
the
part
out
of
sight

some
of
the
pile
which
had
been
driven
in
did
not
appear
abov
water

so
that
it
was
danger
to
sail
up

for
fear
of
run
the
ship
upon
them

just
as
upon
a
reef

through
not
see
them

howev
diver
went
down
and
saw
off
even
these
for
reward

although
the
syracusan
drove
in
other

indeed
there
was
no
end
to
the
contriv
to
which
they
resort
against
each
other

as
might
be
expect
between
two
hostil
armi
confront
each
other
at
such
a
short
distanc

and
skirmish
and
all
kind
of
other
attempt
were
of
constant
occurr

meanwhil
the
syracusan
sent
embassi
to
the
citi

compos
of
corinthian

ambraciot

and
lacedaemonian

to
tell
them
of
the
captur
of
plemmyrium

and
that
their
defeat
in
the
sea
fight
was
due
less
to
the
strength
of
the
enemi
than
to
their
own
disord

and
general

to
let
them
know
that
they
were
full
of
hope

and
to
desir
them
to
come
to
their
help
with
ship
and
troop

as
the
athenian
were
expect
with
a
fresh
armi

and
if
the

adopt

they
cut
down

had

engag
the

at

the
syracusan
thought
that
they
would
thus
have
an
advantag
over
the
athenian
vessel

which
were
not
construct
with
equal
strength

but
were
slight
in

from
their
be
more
use
to
sail
round
and
charg
the

s
side
than
to
meet
him
prow
to
prow

and
that
the
battl
be
in
the
great
harbour

with
a
great
mani
ship
in
not
much
room

was
also
a
fact
in
their
favour

charg
prow
to
prow

they
would
stave
in
the
enemi
s
bow

by
strike
with
solid
and
stout
beak
against
hollow
and
weak
one

and
second

the
athenian
for
want
of
room
would
be
unabl
to
use
their
favourit
manoeuvr
of
break
the
line
or
of
sail
round

as
the
syracusan
would
do
their
best
not
to
let
them
do
the
one

and
want
of
room
would
prevent
their
do
the
other

this
charg
prow
to
prow

which
had
hitherto
been
thought
want
of
skill
in
a
helmsman

would
be
the
syracusan

chief
manoeuvr

as
be
that
which
they
should
find
most
use

sinc
the
athenian

if
repuls

would
not
be
abl
to
back
water
in
ani
direct
except
toward
the
shore

and
that
onli
for
a
littl
way

and
in
the
littl
space
in
front
of
their
own
camp

the
rest
of
the
harbour
would
be
command
by
the
syracusan

and
the
athenian

if
hard
press

by
crowd
togeth
in
a
small
space
and
all
to
the
same
point

would
run
foul
of
one
anoth
and
fall
into
disord

which
was

in
fact

the
thing
that
did
the
athenian
most
harm
in
all
the
sea
fight

they
not
have

like
the
syracusan

the
whole
harbour
to
retreat
over

as
to
their
sail
round
into
the
open
sea

this
would
be
imposs

with
the
syracusan
in
possess
of
the
way
out
and
in

especi
as
plemmyrium
would
be
hostil
to

and
the

of

was
not

with

contriv
to
suit

while

flush
with

now
advanc

wish
to
make

as

to

the
boeotian
made
the
first
stand
against

attack
them

rout
them

and
put
them
to

the
athenian
now
fell
into
great
disord
and
perplex

so
that
it
was
not
easi
to
get
from

side
or

ani
detail
account
of
the

by

certain
the
combat
have
a
clearer
notion

though
even
then
by
no

of
all
that
take
place

no
one
know
much
of
anyth
that
doe
not
go
on
in
his

immedi
neighbourhood

but
in
a
night
engag

and
this
was
the
onli
one
that
occur
between
great
armi
dure
the
war

how
could
ani
one
know
anyth
for
certain

although
there
was
a
bright
moon
they
saw
each
other
onli
as
men
do
by
moonlight

that
is
to
say

they
could
distinguish
the
form
of
the
bodi

but
could
not
tell
for
certain
whether
it
was
a
friend
or
an
enemi

both
had
great
number
of
heavi
infantri
move
about
in
a
small
space

some
of
the
athenian
were
alreadi
defeat

while
other
were
come
up
yet
unconqu
for
their
first
attack

a
larg
part
also
of
the
rest
of
their
forc
either
had
onli
just
got
up

or
were
still
ascend

so
that
they
did
not
know
which
way
to
march

owing
to
the
rout
that
had
taken
place
all
in
front
was
now
in
confus

and
the
nois
made
it
difficult
to
distinguish
anyth

the
victori
syracusan
and
alli
were
cheer
each

on

cri

by

the
onli

even

might

was

also
made
it
known
to
the
enemi

whose
own
they
did
not
so
readili
discov

as
the
syracusan
were
victori
and
not
scatter

and
thus
less
easili
mistaken

the
result
was
that
if
the
athenian
fell
in
with
a
parti
of
the
enemi
that
was
weaker
than
they

it
escap
them

while
if

themselv

they
were
put

but
what
hurt
them
as

or
inde
more

was
the

the

this
was
the

his

there

for

the

had
now
gain
a

victori
at

where
until

they
had
fear
the

brought
by

after
this

nicia
at

gave
order
to
man
the
ship

meanwhil
gylippus
and
the
syracusan
could
perceiv
by
the
prepar
which
they
saw
go
on
that
the
athenian
meant
to
fight
at
sea

they
had
also
notic
of
the
grappl
iron

against
which
they
special
provid
by
stretch
hide
over
the
prow
and
much
of
the
upper

of

in
order
that
the
iron
when
thrown
might
slip
off

syracusan
and

the
glorious
charact
of
our
past
achiev
and
the
no
less
glorious
result
at
issu
in
the
come
battl
are

we
think

understood
by
most
of
you

or
you
would
never
have
thrown
yourselv
with
such
ardour
into
the
struggl

and
if
there
be
ani
one
not
as
fulli
awar
of
the
fact
as
he
ought
to
be

we
will
declar
them
to
him

the
athenian
came
to
this
countri
first
to
effect
the
conquest
of
sicili

and
after
that

if
success

of
peloponnes
and
the
rest
of
hella

possess
alreadi
the
greatest
empir
yet
known

of
present
or
former
time

among
the
hellen

here
for
the
first
time
they
found
in
you
men
who
face
their
navi
which
made
them
master
everywher

you
have
alreadi
defeat
them
in
the
previous
sea
fight

and
will
in
all
likelihood
defeat
them
again
now

when
men
are
onc
check
in
what
they
consid
their
special
excel

their
whole
opinion
of
themselv
suffer
more
than
if
they
had
not
at
first
believ
in
their
superior

the
unexpect
shock
to
their
pride
caus
them
to
give
way
more
than
their
real
strength
warrant

and
this
is
probabl
now
the
case
with
the
athenian



with
us
it
is
differ

the
origin
estim
of
ourselv
which
gave
us
courag
in
the
day
of
our
unskil
has
been
strengthen

while
the
convict
superad
to
it
that
we
must
be
the
best
seamen
of
the
time

if
we
have
conquer
the
best

has
given
a
doubl
measur
of
hope
to
everi
man
among
us

and

for
the
most
part

where
there
is
the
greatest
hope

there
is
also
the
greatest
ardour
for
action

the
mean
to
combat
us
which
they
have
tri
to
find
in
copi
our
armament
are
familiar
to
our
warfar

and
will
be
met
by
proper
provis

while
they
will
never
be
abl
to
have
a
number
of
heavi
infantri
on
their
deck

contrari
to
their
custom

and
a
number
of
darter

born
landsmen

one
may
say

acarnanian
and
other

embark
afloat

who
will
not
know
how
to
discharg
their
weapon
when
they
have
to
keep
still


without
hamper
their
vessel
and
fall
all
into
confus
among
themselv
through
fight
not
accord
to
their
own
tactic

for
they
will
gain
noth
by
the
number
of
their

i
say
this
to
those
of
you
who
may
be
alarm
by
have
to
fight
against
odd

as
a
quantiti
of

in

will
onli
be
slower
in

the
movement
requir

and
most
expos
to
injuri
from
our
mean
of
offenc

indeed

if
you
would
know
the
plain
truth

as
we
are
credibl
inform

the
excess
of
their
suffer
and
the
necess
of
their
present
distress
have
made
them
desper

they
have
no
confid

but
wish
to
tri
their

in
the
onli
way
they
can

and
either
to
forc
their
passag
and
sail
out

or
after
this
to
retreat
by

it
be
imposs
for
them
to
be
wors
off
than
they
are



the
fortun
of
our
greatest
enemi
have
thus
betray
itself

and
their
disord
be
what
i
have
describ

let
us
engag
in
anger

convinc
that

as
between

noth
is
more
legitim
than
to
claim
to
sate
the
whole
wrath
of
one
s
soul
in
punish
the
aggressor

and
noth
more
sweet

as
the
proverb
has
it

than
the
vengeanc
upon
an
enemi

which
it
will
now
be
our
to
take

that
enemi
they
are
and
mortal
enemi
you
all
know

sinc
they
came
here
to
enslav
our
countri

and
if
success
had
in
reserv
for
our
men
all
that
is
most
dread

and
for
our

and
wive
all
that
is
most
dishonour

and
for
the
whole
citi
the
name
which
convey
the
greatest
reproach

none
should
therefor
relent
or
think
it
gain
if
they
go
away
without
further
danger
to
us

this
they
will
do
just
the

even
if
they
get
the
victori

while
if
we
succeed

as
we
may
expect

in
chastis
them

and
in
hand
down
to
all
sicili
her
ancient
freedom
strengthen

we
shall
have

no

and
the

are
those
in

establish

in

from

renew

went
and
state
his
view
to
the

point
out
to
them
that
they
ought
not
to

the

get

that
all

should
at

march
out

block
up

and
seiz
and
guard

the

were
entir
of

thought
that
it

be
done

on

felt
sure

their

they

on

most
of
them
in

raptur
at

had
fallen
to
drink
at
the
festiv

and
would
probabl
consent
to
anyth
sooner
than
to
take
up
their
arm
and
march
out
at
that
moment

for
these
reason
the
thing
appear
impractic
to
the
magistr

and
hermocr

find
himself
unabl
to
do
anyth
further
with
them

had
now
recours
to
the
follow
stratagem
of
his
own

what
he
fear
was
that
the
athenian
might
quiet
get
the
start
of
them
by
pass
the
most
difficult
place
dure
the
night

and
he
therefor
sent

as
soon
as
it
was
dusk

some
friend
of
his
own
to
the
camp
with
some
horsemen
who
rode
up
within

and

determin

most
use

and

leav

to

was
strict
necessari
for

meanwhil
the

and
gylippus
march
out
and
block
up

through
the

by
which
the

were
like

and
kept

at

post
themselv
so

while

sail
up
to

beach
and
tow
off

some

had

lash
on
to

as
they
had
been
thrown
up
on

without

tri

stop
them

and
convey
to

after
this

nicia
and
demosthen
now
think
that
enough
had
been
done
in
the
way
of
prepar

the
remov
of
the
armi
took
place
upon
the
second
day
after
the
sea
fight

it
was
a
lament
scene

not
mere
from
the
singl
circumst
that
they
were
retreat
after
have
lost
all
their
ship

their
great
hope
gone

and
themselv
and
the
state
in
peril

but
also
in
leav
the
camp
there
were
thing
most
grievous
for
everi
eye
and
heart
to
contempl

the
dead
lay
unburi

and
each
man
as
he
recogn
a
friend
among
them
shudder
with
grief
and
horror

while
the
live
whom
they
were
leav
behind

wound
or
sick

were
to
the
live
far
more
shock
than
the
dead

and
more
to
be
piti
than
those
who
had
perish

these
fell
to
entreat
and
bewail
until
their
friend
knew
not
what
to
do

beg
them
to
take
them
and
loud
call
to
each
individu
comrad
or
relat
whom
they
could
see

hang
upon
the
neck
of
their
tent
fellow
in
the
act
of
departur

and
follow
as
far
as
they
could

and

when
their
bodili
strength
fail
them

call
again
and
again
upon
heaven
and
shriek
aloud
as
they
were
left
behind

so
that
the
whole
armi
be
fill
with
tear
and
distract
after
this
fashion
found
it
not
easi
to
go

even
from
an
enemi
s
land

where
they
had
alreadi
suffer
evil
too
great
for
tear
and
in
the
unknown
futur
befor
them
fear
to
suffer
more

deject
and
self
condemn
were
also
rife
among
them

indeed
they
could
onli
be
compar
to
a
starv
out
town

and
that
no
small
one

escap

the
whole
multitud
upon
the
march
be
not
less
than
forti
thousand
men

all
carri
anyth
they
could
which
might
be
of
use

and
the
heavi
infantri
and
trooper

contrari
to
their
wont

while
under
arm
carri
their
own
victual

in
some
case
for
want
of
servant

in
other
through
not
trust
them

as
they
had
long
been
desert
and
now
did
so
in
greater
number
than
ever

yet
even
thus
they
did
not
carri
enough

as
there
was
no
longer
food
in
the
camp

moreov
their
disgrac
general

and
the
univers
of
their
suffer

howev
to
a
certain
extent
allevi
by
be
born
in
compani

were
still
felt
at
the
moment
a
heavi
burden

especi
when
they
contrast
the
splendour
and
glori
of
their
set
out
with
the
humili
in
which
it
had
end

for
this
was
by
far
the
greatest
revers
that
ever
befel
an
hellen
armi

they
had
come
to
enslav
other

and
were
depart
in
fear
of
be
enslav
themselv

they
had
sail
out
with
prayer
and
paean

and
now
start
to
go
back
with
omen
direct
contrari

travel
by
land
instead
of
by
sea

and
trust
not
in
their
fleet
but
in
their
heavi
infantri

nevertheless
the
great
of
the
danger
still
impend
made
all
this
appear
toler


nicia
see
the
armi
deject
and
great

pass
along

athenian

even
in

we

still
hope

have
ere

been

and
you
must
not
condemn
yourselv
too

suffer

i

inde

i
think

whether
in

or
otherwis

the
equal
of
ani

am
now
expos

the

danger
as
the
meanest
among

and
yet
my
life
has
been
one
of
much
devot
toward
the
god

and
of
much
justic
and
without
offenc
toward

i
have

therefor

still
a
strong
hope
for
the

and
our
misfortun
do
not
terrifi
me
as
much
as
they
might

indeed
we
may
hope
that
they
will
be
lighten

our
enemi
have
had
good
fortun
enough

and
if
ani
of
the
god
was

at

we
have
been
alreadi
ampli

befor
us
have
attack
their

and
have
done
what
men
will
do
without
suffer
more
than
they

bear

and
we
may
now
just
expect
to
find
the
god
more
kind

for
we
have
becom
fitter
object
for

and
then
look
at
yourselv

mark
the
number
and
effici
of
the

march
in

and
do
not
give

reflect

you

establish

the

the

the

reject

this
seem
the

nicia

were
butcher

against

of
gylippus

who
thought
that
it
would
be
the
crown
of
his
triumph
if
he
could
take
the
enemi
s
general
to
lacedaemon

one
of
them

as
it
happen

demosthen

was
one
of
her
greatest
enemi

on
account
of
the
affair
of
the
island
and
of

while
the
other

nicia

was
for
the

reason
one
of
her
greatest
friend

owe
to
his
exert
to
procur
the
releas
of
the
prison
by
persuad
the
athenian
to
make
peac

for
these
reason
the
lacedaemonian
felt
kind
toward
him

and
it
was
in
this
that
nicia
himself
main
confid
when
he
surrend
to
gylippus

but
some
of
the
syracusan
who
had
been
in

with
him
were
afraid

it
was
said

of

put

persuad

put

this

of

of

after

they

the

the

assembl
at

to

meanwhil
they
would
take

half
the

across

and
let

in

that
the
athenian
might
attend
less
to

squadron
than
to
those
to
be
taken
across
afterward

as
no
care
had
been
taken
to
keep
this
voyag
secret
through
contempt
of
the
impot
of
the
athenian

who
had
as
yet
no

of

upon

agreeabli
to
this
determin

twenti

were
at

they
were
now
impati
to

the

while
the

citi

he
said

had
had
to

larg

befor
their

and
could
not
just
refus
to

or
even

for

he
also
point
out
that
tissaphern
was
at

carri
on
the

at
his
own
charg

and
had
good
caus
for
economi

but
that
as
soon
as
he
receiv
remitt
from
the
king
he
would
give
them
their
pay
in
full
and
do
what
was
reason
for
the
citi


alcibiad
further
advis
tissaphern
not
to
be
in
too
great
a
hurri
to
end
the
war

or
to
let
himself
be
persuad
to
bring
up
the
phoenician
fleet
which
he
was
equip

or
to
provid
pay
for
more
hellen

and
thus
put
the
power
by
land
and
sea
into
the
same
hand

but
to
leav
each
of
the
contend
parti
in
possess
of
one
element

thus
enabl
the
king
when
he
found
one
troublesom
to
call
in
the
other

for
if
the
command
of
the
sea
and
land
were
unit
in
one
hand

he
would
not
know
where
to
turn
for
help
to
overthrow
the

power

unless
he
at
last
chose
to
stand
up
himself

and
go
through
with
the
struggl
at
great
expens
and
hazard

the
cheapest
plan
was
to
let
the
hellen
wear
each
other
out

at
a
small
share
of
the
expens
and
without
risk
to
himself

besid

he
would
find
the
athenian
the
most
conveni
partner
in
empir
as
they
did
not
aim
at
conquest
on
shore

and
carri
on
the
war
upon
principl
and
with
a
practic
most
advantag
to
the

be
prepar
to
combin
to
conquer
the

for
athen

and
for
the
king
all
the
hellen
inhabit
his
countri

whom
the
peloponnesian

on
the
contrari

had
come
to
liber

now
it
was
not
like
that
the
lacedaemonian
would
free
the
hellen
from
the
hellen
athenian

without
free
them
also
from
the
barbarian
mede

unless
overthrown
by
him
in
the
meanwhil

alcibiad
therefor
urg
him
to
wear
them
both
out
at
first

and

after
dock
the
athenian
power
as
much
as
he
could

forthwith
to
rid
the
countri
of
the
peloponnesian

in
the
main
tissaphern
approv
of
this
polici

so
far
at
least
as
could
be
conjectur
from
his
behaviour

sinc
he
now
gave
his
confid
to
alcibiad
in
recognit
of
his
good
advic

and
kept
the
peloponnesian
short
of
money

and
would
not
let
them
fight
at
sea

but
ruin
their
caus
by
pretend
that
the
phoenician
fleet
would
arriv

and
that
they
would
thus
be
enabl
to
contend
with
the
odd
in
their
favour

and
so
made
their
navi
lose
it
effici

which
had
been
veri
remark

and
general
betray
a
cool
in
the
war
that
was
too
plain
to
be
mistaken


alcibiad
gave
this
advic
to
tissaphern
and
the
king

with
whom
he
then
was

not
mere
becaus
he
thought
it
realli
the
best

but
becaus
he
was
studi
mean
to
effect
his
restor
to
his
countri

well
know
that
if
he
did
not
destroy
it
he
might
one
day
hope
to
persuad
the
athenian
to
recal
him

and
think
that
his
best
chanc
of
persuad
them
lay
in
let
them
see
that
he
possess
the
favour
of
tissaphern

the
event
prove
him
to
be
right

when
the
athenian
at
samo
found
that
he

princip
of

though
part
also
through

he
would

and
afterward
from

some

cross
over

had
an

with

who
immedi

the

upon

to

recal

while
for
themselv

defeat
the

who
appear

withdrew

their

of
oper
instead
of

as
they
could
better
observ
from
thenc
if
the

put

meanwhil
xenophant

a

came
to

from

at

with
the

that
the

and
that

unless
the

the

upon
this
they
resolv

with
the
mercenari
that
he
had
with

and
the
whole
forc
of

made
an

upon

work
round

and
got

after

the

were
besieg
even
more
strait
than
befor
by

and
the
famin
in

meanwhil
the

with

arriv
at

of
tissaphern

confer

about
the

agreement

howev

alcibiad

not
be

of

who
fear
the
peloponnesian
more
than
the
athenian

and
besid
wish
to
wear
out
both
parti

as
alcibiad
himself
had
recommend


had
recours
to
the
follow
stratagem
to
make
the
treati
between
the
athenian
and
tissaphern
miscarri
by
reason
of
the
magnitud
of
his
demand

in
my
opinion
tissaphern
desir
this
result

fear
be
his
motiv

while
alcibiad

who
now
saw
that
tissaphern
was
determin
not
to
treat
on
ani
term

wish
the
athenian
to
think

not
that
he
was
unabl
to
persuad
tissaphern

but
that
after
the
latter
had
been
persuad
and
was
will
to
join
them

they
had
not
conced
enough
to
him

for
the
demand
of
alcibiad

speak
for
tissaphern

who
was
present

were
so
extravag
that
the
athenian

although
for
a
long
while
they
agre
to
whatev
he
ask

yet
had
to
bear
the
blame
of
failur

he
requir
the
cession
of
the
whole
of
ionia

next
of
the
island
adjac

besid
other
concess

and
these
pass
without
opposit

at
last

in
the
third
interview

alcibiad

who
now
fear
a
complet
discoveri
of
his
inabl

requir
them
to
allow
the
king
to
build
ship
and
sail
along
his
own
coast
wherev
and
with
as
mani
as
he
pleas

upon
this
the
athenian
would
yield
no
further

and
conclud
that
there
was
noth
to
be
done

but
that
they
had
been
deceiv
by
alcibiad

went
away
in
a
passion
and
proceed
to
samo


tissaphern
immedi
after
this

in
the

winter

proceed
along
shore
to
caunus

desir
to
bring
the
peloponnesian
fleet
back
to
miletus

and
to
suppli
them
with
pay

make
a
fresh
convent
upon
such
term
as
he
could
get

in
order
not
to
bring
matter
to
an
absolut
breach
between
them

he
was
afraid
that
if
mani
of
their
ship
were
left
without
pay
they
would
be
compel
to
engag
and
be
defeat

or
that
their
vessel
be
left
without
hand
the
athenian
would
attain
their
object
without
his
assist

still
more
he
fear
that
the
peloponnesian
might
ravag
the
contin
in
search
of
suppli

have
calcul
and
consid
all
this

agreeabl
to
his

of
keep
the

side
equal

from

howev

he
sail
back
to
miletus

as
the
athenian
did
not
put

owe
to
their
suspicion
of

anoth

for
it
was
about
this
time

or
even
befor

that
the
democraci
was
put
down
at
athen

when
pisand
and
the
envoy
return
from
tissaphern
to
samo
they
at
onc
strengthen
still
further
their
interest
in
the
armi
itself

and
instig
the
upper
class
in
samo
to
join
them
in
establish
an
oligarchi

the
veri
form
of
govern
which
a
parti
of
them
had
late
risen
to
avoid

at
the
same
time
the
athenian
at
samo

after
a
consult
among
themselv

determin
to
let
alcibiad
alon

sinc
he
refus
to
join
them

and
besid
was
not
the
man
for
an
oligarchi

and
now
that
they
were
onc
embark

to
see
for
themselv
how
they
could
best
prevent
the
ruin
of
their
caus

and
meanwhil
to
sustain
the
war

and
to
contribut
without
stint
money
and
all
els
that
might
be
requir
from
their
own
privat
estat

as
they
would
henceforth
labour
for
themselv
alon


after
encourag
each
other
in
these
resolut

they
now
at
onc
sent
off
half
the
envoy
and
pisand
to
do
what
was
necessari
at
athen

with
instruct
to
establish
oligarchi
on
their
way
in
all
the
subject
citi
which
they
might
touch
at


and
dispatch
the
other
half
in
differ
direct
to
the
other
depend

diitreph
also

who
was
in
the
neighbourhood
of
chio

and
had
been
elect
to
the
command
of
the
thracian
town

was
sent
off
to
his
govern

and
arriv
at
thaso
abolish
the
democraci

two
month

howev

had
not
elaps
after
his
departur
befor
the
thasian
began
to
fortifi
their
town

be
alreadi
tire
of
an
aristocraci
with
athen

and
in
daili
expect
of
freedom
from
lacedaemon

indeed
there
was
a
parti
of
them

whom
the
athenian
had
banish


with
the
peloponnesian

who
with
their
friend
in
the
town
were
alreadi
make
everi
exert
to
bring
a
squadron

and
to
effect
the
revolt
of
thaso

and
this
parti
thus
saw
exact
what
they
most
want
done

that
is
to
say

the
reform
of
the
govern
without
risk

and
the
abolit
of
the
democraci
which
would
have

thing
at
thaso
thus
turn
out
just
the
contrari
to
what
the
oligarch
conspir
at
athen
expect

and
the
same
in
my
opinion
was
the
case
in
mani
of
the
other
depend

as
the
citi
no
sooner
got
a
moder
govern
and
liberti
of

than
they
went
on
to
absolut
freedom
without

the
show
of

offer
by
the
athenian


pisand
and
his
colleagu
on

alongshor
abolish

as
had
been
determin

the
democraci
in
the
citi

and
also
took
some
heavi
infantri
from
certain
place
as
their
alli

and
so
came
to
athen

here
they
found
most
of
the
work
alreadi
done
by
their
associ

some
of
the
younger
men
had

of

common

and
main
respons
for
the
banish
of
alcibiad

androcl
be
singl
out
both
becaus
he
was
a
popular
leader
and
becaus
they
sought
by
his
death
to
recommend
themselv
to
alcibiad

who
was

as
they
suppos

to
be
recal

and
to
make
tissaphern
their
friend

there
were
also
some
other
obnoxi
person
whom
they
secret
did
away
with
in
the
same
manner

meanwhil
their
cri
in
public
was
that
no
pay
should
be
given
except
to
person
serv
in
the
war

and
that
not
more
than
five
thousand
should
share
in
the
govern

and
those
such
as
were
most
abl
to
serv
the
state
in
person
and
in
purs


but
this
was
a
mere
catchword
for
the
multitud

as
the
author
of
the
revolut
were
realli
to
govern

howev

the
assembl
and
the
council
of

still

although

discuss
noth

of

or

and
there
was
neither

if

but
the
peopl
remain
motionless

be
so
thorough
cow
that
men
thought
themselv
lucki
to

violenc

even
when
they
held
their

an
exagger

in

demor
the

render
helpless
by
the
magnitud

by
their
want
of
intellig

and
be
without
mean
of
find
out
what
those
number
realli
were

for
the

reason
it
was
imposs
for
ani
one
to
open
his
grief
to
a
neighbour
and
to
concert
measur
to
defend
himself

as
he
would
have
had
to
speak
either
to

he

on

the

bound
all

by

most
tremend

and
those
of

more

to

to

the

to

to

the

oath
was
also
taken
by
all
the

of

and
the
soldier
associ
the
samian
in
all
their

in
the
fruit

have
the
convict
that
there
was
no

for

but
that
the
success
of
the
four
hundr

must
be
their
ruin


the
struggl
now
was
between
the
armi
tri
to
forc
a
democraci
upon
the
citi

and
the
four
hundr
an
oligarchi
upon
the

meanwhil
the
soldier
forthwith
held
an
assembl

in
which
they
depos
the
former
general
and
ani
of
the
captain
whom
they
suspect

and
chose
new
captain
and
general
to
replac
them

besid
thrasybulus

thrasyllus

whom
they
had
alreadi

they
also
stood
up
and
encourag
one
anoth

and
among
other
thing
urg
that
they
ought
not
to
lose
heart
becaus
the
citi
had
revolt
from
them

as
the
parti
seced
was
smaller
and
in
everi
way
poorer
in
resourc
than
themselv

they
had
the
whole
fleet
with
which
to
compel
the
other
citi
in

to
give
them
money
just
as
if

so

had
when

while
as
far
as
the

was
concern
they
had
the
same
base
of
oper
as
befor

indeed

with
the
fleet
in
their

they
were
better
abl
to
provid
themselv
with

than
the

it
was
their
advanc
posit
at
samo
which
had
throughout
enabl
the

author

command
the

and
if
they
refus
to
give

back
the

they
would
now
find
that
the
armi
was
more
in
a
posit
to
exclud
them
from

than
they
were
to
exclud
the

besid

the
citi
was
of
littl
or
no
use
toward
enabl
them
to
overcom
the

and
they
had
lost
noth
in
lose
those
who
had
no

money
to

to
find

by

worst
of

euboea

which
was
of
more
valu
to

than
attica

could
not
occur
without
throw
them
into
the
deepest
despond

meanwhil
their
greatest
and
most
immedi
troubl
was
the
possibl
that
the
enemi

embolden
by
his
victori

might
make
straight
for
them
and
sail
against
piraeus

which
they
had
no
longer
ship
to
defend

and
everi
moment
they
expect
him
to
arriv

this

with
a
littl
more
courag

he
might
easili
have
done

in
which
case
he
would
either
have
increas
the
dissens
of
the

by
his
presenc

or

if
he
had
stay
to
besieg
it

have
compel
the

from

although
the
enemi
of
the
oligarchi

to
come
to
the
rescu
of
their
countri
and
of
their
relat

and
in
the
meantim
would
have
becom
master
of
the
hellespont

ionia

the
island

and
of
everyth
as
far
as
euboea

or

to
speak
round

of
the
whole
athenian
empir

but
here

as
on
so
mani
other
occas

the
lacedaemonian
prove
the
most
conveni
peopl
in
the
world
for
the
athenian
to
be
at

with

the
wide
differ
between
the
two
charact

the
slow
and
want
of
energi
of
the
lacedaemonian
as
contrast
with
the
dash
and
enterpris
of
their
oppon

prove
of
the
greatest
servic

especi
to
a
maritim
empir
like
athen

indeed
this
was
shown
by
the
syracusan

who
were
most
like
the
athenian
in
charact

and
also
most
success
in
combat
them


nevertheless

upon

it

the

this
was
